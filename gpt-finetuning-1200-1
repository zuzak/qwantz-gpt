T-Rex: I have a great idea for a movie. And it's about a group of teenagers who learn each other's hard rock 'em!

T-Rex: I'm going to play it totally random and have one teen (Jennifer Aniston) as the lead.

Dromiceiomimus: But does anyone really know what songs are appropriate for lead films?
T-Rex: Yes, but only for musicians. The rest of us are just making up songs. I'll call it "The Movie: Songs Aren't Really Enough"!
T-Rex: Ladies and gentlemen: YOU'RE doing it wrong.

Utahraptor: What the hell, son, are you doing?!
T-Rex: I'm - I'm just being HIM!

Utahraptor: What are you even doing? You're creating this dumb and terrible idea and then casting ALL THE MOVIES IN SO LONG, HARD DOOM that it's actually hard to make things sound awesome??
T-Rex: Son. I'm doing it wrong.

Narrator: MAN, THIS IS THE WORST.
