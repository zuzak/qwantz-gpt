T-Rex: I've made the best breakfast of my life! I'm loaded, and I'm ready.

T-Rex: Now I'm ready to eat all the delicious burgers and pork chops and have no idea what to do!!

T-Rex: That's because I'm not a man to make tasty breakfast friends, and today I made a delicious breakfast friend!
Dromiceiomimus: Aunt Petey's made a friend, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Aunt Petey is loaded?

Utahraptor: I'm loaded, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Yes, as an adult I am responsible to all.

Utahraptor: But it is objectively better to go on a meal with friends, and there's no reason to be complaining about your lousy breakfast when you can just make yourself laugh at eating the same burgers and chops with friends you never actually eat.

T-Rex: Aunt Petey has loaded the sandwich!
Utahraptor: Yes, I think you are a bit hoity-toity about eating the same burgers and chops with friends!
