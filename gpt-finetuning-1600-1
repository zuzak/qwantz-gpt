T-Rex: Alright, let me try something.  A steamboat is like a boat with sails turned right-angle.  The steam can go up to the top!

T-Rex: The sails can be turned up to the boat's side!

T-Rex: The sails can be turned all the way around!  The stern can be turned upwards, or up to its side!  The engine can be turned around, up, or down!
Dromiceiomimus: These are very, very, very specific ways of imagining things.
T-Rex: OK

T-Rex: Then I guess I'll flip a switch!
Utahraptor: Okay

Utahraptor: A steamboat is like a steam boat that's still in top gear when it spins right?
T-Rex: FRIG
Utahraptor: Yeah you read that right.  And it's not just a "Switching from airplane propellers to boat propellers", but an "Into Space" voyage!

T-Rex: What?!  What kind of questions would interest you in an "Into Space" voyage?
T-Rex: Um, are they going to: Antarctica, Middle-earth, or River Giffs??

T-Rex: I would be sending her off to explore the places I already know about!!
T-Rex: INTERNET
