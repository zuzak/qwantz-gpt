T-Rex: You know how sometimes you wonder what your life would be like, if only you spent a little more time doing that stuff?  Well!  YOU WISH TO BE TOTALLY LIVING.

T-Rex: Oh man, YES you would!  You would spend more time every day, on average, spending 6 hours every year on things that interest you!

T-Rex: Wouldn't you be WAY more fun, Dromiceiomimus?  I'd spend less time on things I like and less time on things I don't like, on average!  I'd also be spending less TIME ON THINGS I DON'T REALLY THINK ARE PROFICING OR BUSY.
Dromiceiomimus: Actually, you'd have less trouble with them than you would with eating less.  They only put on weight!
T-Rex: ... Less weight?

Utahraptor: Yeah, less on stress and happiness!
T-Rex: What?

Utahraptor: Yeah - the world around you gets filled up with other things that you don't want to deal with.  And if you're stuck, you don't even have a phone to call!  And anyway, the nearest phone would be in your parents' basement.
T-Rex: A phone that grows up??

Utahraptor: I see.  What is the point of living in a distant land if I can't visit my parents at my earliest convenience?
T-Rex: Well, you don't need to though cause all the bad things are already there!  That's part of the game too.
T-Rex: ... Anyway!
T-Rex: So now we're getting to part of the prize!
