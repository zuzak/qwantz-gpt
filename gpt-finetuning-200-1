T-Rex: There's no denying that movies are movies! And it's probably true.

Narrator: I'VE GOT NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT

T-Rex: But I do have reason to believe that when I die, I WILL be buried on that damn spot AND I MUST DIE FIRST.
Dromiceiomimus: Huh? I guess you're saying you don't have any reason to believe that you can do anything!
T-Rex: If they're true then that would be a major reason I would be in hell for this movie.

T-Rex: It's not like I can do anything! I could do everything, but I'm not even saying I'm totally in heaven!!
Utahraptor: Well it's true. It's impossible that you could DO anything.

Narrator: THE END

Narrator: BECAUSE HORSES
Narrator: IT'S THE BEST OF HORSES WHERE I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN MURDED:
