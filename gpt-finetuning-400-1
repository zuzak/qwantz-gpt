T-Rex:  Today I have a secret!

T-Rex: It's that I haven't had the fun of a lifetime this week!

Narrator:  THE SECRET TO LITERATURE ENTHUSIASTS

T-Rex:  A woman is sexy as she gets on a horse!  She needs to be on a horse, not a horse, to seduce that woman.  In reality, women don't go off horse rides!  Ladies ride horses.  They're too soft/hard to ride AND they're not sexy.  They're too sexy themselves.  In my imagination, a horse is sexy as she slips out the passenger window.

Narrator:  THE SECRET THEORY OF LITERATURE ENTHUSASTS CONCLUDED!

T-Rex:  This is amazing:  if I had the chance I could say "Hey, that horse's a woman!  I'd like to seduce one." And then I just laughed out loud.  It would be the greatest joke ever.
Dromiceiomimus:  Hey man!  This woman's got a pretty sweet heart.
T-Rex:  Hah!  This is how I know she's a woman.
Utahraptor:  Hah!  This is how I know she'll kiss when I kiss her. 

God: It's time to go kill off the zombies!
