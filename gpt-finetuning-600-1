T-Rex: One day, something special happened to me... something so great, I was so happy that I let THAT happen.

T-Rex: It is my belief that I will always have a place within myself, an inner sense of self -

T-Rex: - and an inner drive and purpose to live for. A passion that is forever on display at the office, waiting to be explored and shared!
Dromiceiomimus: What are you looking for? To share a moment of quiet and inner joy?
T-Rex: Nothing, actually! This is to be taken for granted, as such, I will take it up.

Utahraptor: You didn't know there was a special place for you in yourself?
T-Rex: Well I guess?

T-Rex: I guess: a place I want to be forever forever forever.
Utahraptor: Is that going to be possible?
T-Rex: Oh wow I could definitely do so!

Banner: One day I will end up on the moon, right?
T-Rex: I bet there'd be a moon in the orbit of Saturn, and as we know, the moon would eventually reach us from another planet!  I would be forever there, forever, forever!  Every time we try to approach it, I will be there, literally, just above the moon, just above the empty sky!

T-Rex: And I WILL kill time and energy and make it even bigger by exploding on the planet myself!
Voice: One day, I will end up on the moon orbiting a giant robotic probe, just above Saturn, just above the empty sky!
T-Rex: It was the best!
