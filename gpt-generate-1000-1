Utahraptor: I'm a new dude, T-Rex!

Utahraptor: You're a dude who has literally MILLIONS of fantasy lives open to him, and you're putting them in a genre that doesn't really has a soul, and you're hoping his body will one day catch up with them.
T-Rex: I don't know why you're picking on me, Utahraptor, but I love writing friggin' friggin' epic fantasy.
