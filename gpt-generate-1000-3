T-Rex: Oh God, how amazing is it that you can have a dude who does all the things you want him to, even if he's JUST PISSED.
T-Rex: I know because I've seen him work it in: he's really good at everything, and I know because I've seen him do it.

T-Rex: It makes me sad sometimes.

Dromiceiomimus: Dude, how can you have all the things you want if you don't want to work them in?
T-Rex: I sure do have a good heart!

Utahraptor: Well, how do you know? You're just got a really good eye.
T-Rex: Yeah, I do.

Utahraptor: Well, I mean, you're sort of blind, but you're ALSO really good at imagining what other people will think of you.
T-Rex: Oh, I'm gonna! I'm gonna be all in the "Oh God, how amazing is it that you can have all the things you want him to, even if he's JUST BEATING IT ON HIS SECOND BATHROOM WINDOWS." Swearing of the "Make sure you're warm on your second birthday" comment!

Narrator: LATER: T-REX INSCRIBES EVERYONE FROM THE UNIVERSE WHO HAS A BATHROOM WINDOW
T-Rex: Aw man, this is gonna be the worst!!
T-Rex: I NEED TO GO HOME TO SNOW CONFESSIONS
