T-Rex: Hello, Dromiceiomimus! I'm here to change the world!
Dromiceiomimus: I'm here to change the world?
T-Rex: You're not, T-Rex! You're a ghost!
Dromiceiomimus: I'm here to change the world!
T-Rex: You're not, T-Rex! You're a ghost!

Utahraptor: So, T-Rex, what happened?
T-Rex: Well!

T-Rex: I guess I just remembered how you always seemed to trip when she looks up when nobody's around.
Utahraptor: Well, I guess I guess she never really talked to you either.
T-Rex: Oh, I guess that's true.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX HAS ALONE:
T-Rex: Oh my god!
T-Rex: I have died, Utahraptor!!
T-Rex: You've been on my body for like seven hours now!!
