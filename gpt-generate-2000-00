Narrator: T-REX IN: "WRAPPING PRESENTS IN THE PLACE OF HAND"
T-Rex: It's been a memorable two weeks indeed!

T-Rex: Hey, remember when there were books that said that the quiet person didn't care about being sad?

T-Rex: It was because I had a book of the thing. And then I flipped through a book and briefly considered whether I really wanted to be a quiet person, or whether the quiet person was simply too busy being a quietly used person for me to even realize I was there!
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, calm down! Don't flatter yourself that being a quietly used person is somehow important!

Utahraptor: T-Rex, your quiet person status is based on your ability to talk and read your own words!
T-Rex: That's right!

T-Rex: While you may claim to be a quiet person because you love quiet times, you're actually a busy person who uses his or her busyness to his or her own advantage!
Utahraptor: That's so GROSS.
T-Rex: It is entirely possible that you use your busyness to your advantage while quietly exploiting my decision!

Narrator: BUT SOON:
T-Rex: Aw dang, remember when we had that conversation??
T-Rex: I had a book of the thing!
