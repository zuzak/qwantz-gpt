T-Rex: I am a guy who says "be nice and smart and smart". If I don't have a nice nice nice nice friend then MAYBE, but I'm out of friends.

T-Rex: Another way to put it is if I'm dating someone, I might as well just hang out with them until they're dead and gone.

T-Rex: Life's funny, Dromiceiomimus. If I'm having a hang out with a Dromiceiomimus then my problems could be SOLVED.
Dromiceiomimus: Sure! But how can a distant relative be SO OFF THE HOOK that he or she doesn't visit my grave for me?
T-Rex: Utahraptor, that sounds like the sort of thing I'm up to!

Utahraptor: Well, I'm up to my own (relative) acoustics.
T-Rex: Down to my own doing.

Utahraptor: And if distant relatives don't visit my grave for me then MAYBE, but I'm not coming to your grave for MAYBE.
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I'm down to my own doing.

T-Rex: And furthermore, if I'm being weirded on then don't visit TIMOTHY-LIFE PASTE DUDE MURDER, either!
T-Rex: Hah hah!
T-Rex: HOWEVER, I WILL NOT BE BORN FOR FIVE EITHER DAYS LATE OR IN THE ARRIVALS ON THAT DAY.
