T-Rex:  Millions of years ago, life on Earth was pretty okay.  Things were going fine.  Things would go fine.

T-Rex:  Well, then we're going to be writing stories about ME.

T-Rex:  Okay, okay.  Fine.  Ok, imagine if we had, say, 100 stories?  All in which a main character is a vulnerable but competent subway driver who got saved by a vulnerable but competent subway driver?
Dromiceiomimus: Fine.  I'm going to assume that you're a womanizer, my friend.
T-Rex:  Holy crap!!

Utahraptor:  T-Rex, have you considered the relationship between a womanizer and subway driver?
T-Rex:  Oh god

T-Rex:  I think there's a SHORTLY POINTER PARTY HALLOWE'EN that way!  If you call it that, I'm just gonna assume that it's a woman-to-man!
Utahraptor:  Oh god.  Look, I've got a couple of minutes.
T-Rex:  No!
T-Rex:  CALLING IT THAT HAS A bad name.

T-Rex:  Holy crap!  If I call it "the short form of the D and E same gender" then I've totally lost the "e" sound
T-Rex:  neither have I
