T-Rex: A new video game is coming out, and I don't like it.

T-Rex: I don't know!!

T-Rex: I'm NOT sure what the game is going to be, OR even what the gameplay is going to be like. What I want is a game that is both a celebration of video games and a celebration of the culture at large!
Dromiceiomimus: A game where you don't know which friend is?
T-Rex: Exactly!  I want culture in video games, and I don't want it to be a confused mass of conflicting, unfamiliar feelings.

Utahraptor: You want a game where the first video game you play is a confused mass of conflicting, unfamiliar feelings?
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: I'd also love a game where you don't know which character is named "The Rockstar of GTA".
Utahraptor: Rockstar, you're on the cover.  You're dressed up as a woman from the 80s.
T-Rex: Rockstar!  I think I know what that means...

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: "Inspection"?! THE RING IS ACTUALLY 18 YEARS OLDER.
T-Rex: Okay, there's some symbolism there, you know?
T-Rex: There's some - 
T-Rex: Some games still suck, like Grand Theft Auto.
