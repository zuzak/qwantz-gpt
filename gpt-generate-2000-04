T-Rex: I have an idea: if you don't like someone, then they should stop being a jerk! This rule fixes all those problems, except dickfic purposes. Dromiceiomimus and I are going to be excommunicated.

Narrator: T-REX AND THE DEVIL BIP THE ASTEROID IN: "EXCUSE ME, I'M NOT A JERK"

T-Rex: The moral of this story is that it's also a good way to say "NO BAD CHUCKLES" to avoid confusion.
Dromiceiomimus: Well, here's the thing! If you don't like someone, they should stop being a jerk!
T-Rex: Here's why: it implies that you should, in the strongest possible terms, despise everything that is not jerkish!

Utahraptor: I think this is a good idea!
T-Rex: I agree!

T-Rex: It saves us from being yelled at for saying the opposite!
Utahraptor: Really? Really?
T-Rex: YES. YES WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF EVERYTHING, INCLUDING T-REX.

Narrator: BUT T-REX DOES NOT WANT TO TALK:
Utahraptor: Really? Really?
T-Rex: Yes, really? YES WEOULD BE ABLE TO TALK, AND YES WE SHOULD TAKE EXTREME RATE.
