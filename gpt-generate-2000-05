T-Rex: Damn it, I love glasses. I love glasses that say "NOT TOO FRIGGIN' OR WISTY" and I love glasses that say "NOT TOO WISTY" and I love them and I love them and I love them and I love them and I love them and when I walk outside on a hot summer's night -

T-Rex: - I'll take a swig from my iced coffee and wear them as a hat or something!

T-Rex: Like, at a party? 
Dromiceiomimus: Like at a wedding?
T-Rex: Exactly!  They give you the added sparkle and make you look like a totally awesome dude or lady!  Plus, if you end up not looking like a dude or lady, at least you've got a gay date!

Utahraptor: You can totally do both!
T-Rex: Exactly!

Utahraptor: And if you do end up not looking like a dude or lady, at least you've got a straight date!  At least YOU've got a lesbian date!
T-Rex: Um, at least you've got a gay date where we both end up not looking like duds?

T-Rex: At the end of the day, it helps me use my glasses more!
T-Rex: It helps me be more of a cool dude!
T-Rex: *sigh*
