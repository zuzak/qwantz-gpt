T-Rex: I have decided to become a scientist dinosaur, and in doing so I hope to advance science by showing how dinosaur brains can be modified to be used in different roles!

T-Rex: It will be fascinating!

T-Rex: The most important aspect of my plan is that I will be able to reconstruct people's lives while they were doing these activities. I will then be able to further my hypothesis that dinosaurs are not really just machines that do some useful jobs for some people, but rather, really useful people and things that.
T-Rex: I will also be able to apply some of this knowledge to real people, rather than just fetishizing these people.

Utahraptor: The promise of your project is that people can be modified to do other jobs!
T-Rex: Precisely!

T-Rex: I have considered this matter closely and have concluded that without any exceptions, real people can be made to be do other jobs.
Utahraptor: Indeed!
T-Rex: Therefore, I do believe this project can be applied to real people.

T-Rex: I will demonstrate!
T-Rex: [[thought bubble]]DearScience: Scientists!
