Narrator: JANUARY
T-Rex: Who owes me money?

T-Rex: It is a question that haunts me now and I can no longer answer it!

T-Rex: It is this: how do I spend my time when I'm in the best of health and fitness? How do I decide when to hold off on making out until after my friends have finished enjoying themselves and my pals?
T-Rex: Man!
T-Rex: I certainly hope that simple desire will soon die with me!

Utahraptor: Maybe you should hang out on the weekends, man!

T-Rex: Maybe!
T-Rex: But I've decided that I don't want to spend weekends on the side, as that is out of my reach!
Utahraptor: Or perhaps in the best of all possible worlds, where everyone is interacting with other people at the regular pace.

Narrator: THE NEXT MORNING:
T-Rex: Man, today is the day I lose my weekend!
T-Rex: I'll see you next weekend!
