T-Rex: I've come across a way of making any otherwise-simple sentence sinister and creepy!
T-Rex: Secretly, it's also extremely easy to recontextualize!

T-Rex: Suppose I have a question mark. Say it as a sheeple asking a man if he's "cute".

T-Rex: And the man can say "Yes!" and the sheeple can say "WOW... I'm afraid he's a PEDOPHIRE... surrounded by military robots."
Dromiceiomimus: So say something like "Toasty is a cereal with cereal bar; Tellingly Sega is a Sega Genesis with Genesis port.  Okay, you've got my awesome new new sweetie, I've got a shambling horror of the two of you, this is the end."
T-Rex:So end up literally terrorizing the other partygoers?

Utahraptor: Say it like it's a sheep!
T-Rex: Yes!

T-Rex: Well, I've got a question mark. Would you say that you're a sheep?
Utahraptor: Say it like I'm a human!
T-Rex: Yes, as T-Rex, you've just raped another human!
Utahraptor: Holy crap!!

Narrator: SHORTLY:
Utahraptor: The sheeple is laughing now, and you've raped its mom!
T-Rex: Holy crap!!
T-Rex: Wait, what if I -
T-Rex: Me?
