T-Rex: There are some rappers who rhyme like they're afraid of heights. 
T-Rex: ...

T-Rex: Attention, rappers!! You should learn to use your head appropriately.

T-Rex: Attention, rappers!! 
Dromiceiomimus: ...I'm not. 
T-Rex: YOU'RE not. 
T-Rex: Not a bad person, Utahraptor.

Utahraptor: I know, right? 
T-Rex: Right. 

T-Rex: But it's not the purpose of the rhyme to warn you, just as not warning you doesn't warn you in the first place. 
Utahraptor: Instead, it's a warning! 
T-Rex: Um... yes? 

T-Rex: It's not the purpose of the rhyme, is it? 
Utahraptor: Yes. 
T-Rex: Well - that's okay, because I'll be late for work.
