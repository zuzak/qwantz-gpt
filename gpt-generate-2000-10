T-Rex: Let us assume that millions of years from now, the T-Rex will travel through time and space!

T-Rex: That means that we will be able to visit other times yet, across different times, just as we are now!

T-Rex: And this includes visits to other time yet, who will be our tourists? We'll be the Eldritch Time Travelers of Australasia, visiting, perhaps, one of our last remaining Planetside Orinocoin.
Dromiceiomimus: Australasia?
T-Rex: No! Australasia is gone, and our pasts are the usual Nope, I'm Still Screwing with Planetside Orvins!!

Utahraptor: T-Rex, this is a terrible idea!
T-Rex: See? Look, if I were a Planetside Orv in a slightly different time period, I'd say you should get on that.

T-Rex: However, I've already committed myself to being the Planetside Orv of the Universe, and I've already committed myself to being the Screw Making the Universe.
T-Rex: Sorry, Universe, that epitaph is now legally protected against me.
T-Rex: So!
T-Rex: Screw or down, it's the same!
