T-Rex: I have the best idea for a web card game. Um -

T-Rex: Seven years after the game was invented, the next closest person to the game is still playing it!

T-Rex: So it's a three-player "merchandising card game", where each player builds a deck around a card, and then draws a card from their deck. The goal is to double the number of people who play as they build their deck!

T-Rex: Exactly!

Utahraptor: So the players build a deck around each other and then build a game around that!
T-Rex: Yes!

T-Rex: The goal is to double the number of people who play as they build their deck!
Utahraptor: I'm pretty sure that's how that works!
T-Rex: That's pretty implausible! The only cards that do are convince people that build decks around each other and then build games around that.
