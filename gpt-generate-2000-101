T-Rex: I've come across a way better way to live your life! All you have to do is cook some delicious, tasty, delicious food AND of course, upload it to an online cloud-based storage service!

T-Rex: Your life!

T-Rex: Now, it might seem that simple! Wouldn't you love to be able to save your delicious now, right?
T-Rex: But that doesn't make it easy! It means that if you don't have an online storage service, you'll still end up with a lot of other things you don't want to live in. 

Utahraptor: You're saying if you have an online storage service you'll end up with some pretty bad people?
T-Rex: Yeah!

T-Rex: But it's true! I'll probably end up hating everything about myself and wouldn't want that to be an issue. 
Utahraptor: Maybe you shouldn't hate yourself too hard. Maybe the things you hate are the things YOU'VE had problems with.
T-Rex: EXACTLY.

Narrator: LATER, T-REX DOES THE SAME TRICK WITH ULTIMATE SALAD!
T-Rex: Excellent!
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: Alright, final Word Cup!
