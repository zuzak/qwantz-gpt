T-Rex: I have the best idea for a Batman comic. It's a Batman comic about a guy who does tons of crazy things, and I'm going to make a THING. Verily!

T-Rex: Or not.

T-Rex: Or I'm going to make a THING that'll make all sorts of sense!
Dromiceiomimus: Okay, but the thing is, even if you're super prepared to do themself, they're still gonna make sense.
T-Rex: So let's do them!

T-Rex: Okay, so come on, this is a spider! She walks on guys and I can crawl on her for a few pages, so I'm going to draw a picture of a spooky guy (I'll draw a picture of a spooky guy with weird things in his belly, OH GOD) and I'm going to call up the police and they're going to shoot me in the head, so get ready.

Utahraptor: But there's no time for that now!
T-Rex: No!

T-Rex: I'll be operating outside of government protocol, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: Okay.
T-Rex: Fine! Let's do it! I'll draw a picture of a couple with their front legs spread apart, and then I'm going to call up the FOP and demand they put me in a situation in which I can say "You know what? FURTHER, you are to be whipped into a shape appealing to both femininity and professional experience and, as a consequence of this process, I am to be whipped into a bigger and better being."

T-Rex: "After this, I shall be whipped into a shape that is at least as good as his." 
T-Rex: "After that, I shall be whipped into a shape that will make me a giant whipped dinosaur."
