T-Rex: It turns out that being handsome is hard! I've met lots of attractive people, but being straight is straighter than m sure!

T-Rex: That's because being straight is NOT as IMPOSIBLE as saying "I'm straight, I have heterosexual sexual needs, and I'm willing to discuss these issues with you."

T-Rex: Straight people can discuss these issues, but not straight people of color.
Dromiceiomimus: Um. 
T-Rex: Some?

Utahraptor: Straight people can discuss sexual issues, but not straight people of color!
T-Rex: Straight, huh?

Utahraptor: Straight people of color can discuss sexual issues, but not straight people of color either.
T-Rex: It's kinda the same thing, I guess.

T-Rex: But straight people of color can have their issues addressed, and some are too late!
T-Rex: Sometimes it's hard to deal with your issues at the same time!
