T-Rex: Man, I'm pretty sure I could be a pretty good writer, and I am indeed!

T-Rex: I CREATED QUANTUM JOKES.

Dromiceiomimus: Well, there's not really a hard and fast rule for when you should write, and harder for things like when to trust your heart and mind.
T-Rex: But! There are! And the hard ones include thoughts on when and how often to write, as well as thoughts on whether or not to give everything a sympathetic eye. Oh! And give me a break!

Utahraptor: Hey, I also wrote "Forbidden Fruit", "Let's Talk About Fruits", and "Blink, Don't Drink This Liquifyer, and Gosh, It's Really Too Blurryy"!
T-Rex: That's easy!

T-Rex: All I need is a creative excuse! A nice punchline? What's it like? Why do you gotta be so down on things like that?
Utahraptor: Um, maybe it's super cold outside?
T-Rex: Whatever! It's SO cold outside that I can hardly breathe!

T-Rex: I mean, it's like - you take a shower, you throw down, and you're super into your favourite sport?
Utahraptor: Super into your favourite sport?
T-Rex: SUPER.
