T-Rex: I have the best idea. A world where everyone knows how often their eyes are blinks at the colour blue. Imagine?

T-Rex: It'll be SUPER IMPORTANT for our careers and our minds!

T-Rex: So start noticing how often your pupils are blue. Observe how often my pupils are coloured blue.  It'll automatically translate into a high-school graduation party for every student of color. And it'll be all those grad school hats for sale, high school balloons for sale, and one more cheque for every student of colour. It'll all be a clear success. Pretty neat.

Utahraptor: Wow, what a powerful metaphor
T-Rex: I know, right?

T-Rex: It ties in well with the idea that money can buy unimportant traits and skills acquired otherwise. It's very clever, though! And I love it! It says in the title that the illustrative power of the phrase lies in the way in which this metaphorical world undermines any claims of imagination carried out in a non-literal, literal sense.

T-Rex: Phew.
T-Rex: Anyway!  Wow, I got the idea for my comic from comic books!
T-Rex: AS IN, BABY.
