T-Rex: I am a guy who is good at looking in a mirror and failing.  Is there ANY truth to the charge against me, Dromiceiomimus?
Dromiceiomimus: There no, T-Rex!
T-Rex: There certainly is!

T-Rex: I stood up tall in my younger years, and then I'd stare longingly out of a window into the future, waiting for some shock to materialize.  I was a friggin' amateur.
Utahraptor: I stood up tall in my heyday too, but now I'm just brutish and short.

T-Rex: Man, I'm glad we live in a world where nobody can see me now, but I have some questions that I'd like answered.
Utahraptor: Yes! Can we work on having my prime moiety posed in a mirror at the same time?
T-Rex: I will of necessity refuse!
