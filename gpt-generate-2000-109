Narrator: THE NEXT MORNING:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Today I ran into the Utahraptor! He's this strange green creature with a weird sense of humour, which I was hoping to hear about him. I thought maybe he was into bitches, bitches. I actually really appreciate his sense of humour!

T-Rex: Anyway, I am going to bed.

T-Rex: I woke up the next morning to a very different story.

T-Rex: The next morning I could have easily told you my story. Instead I told you this one awesome story!
Dromiceiomimus: "The Utahraptor was a Green Construct who dreamed he was dead. He woke up to a strange noise and found himself in a universe where he could make only the most delicious bits of whatever. He then spent the rest of his life being made to look like a cartoon frog."
T-Rex: It's amazing!!

T-Rex: The moral of the story?
Utahraptor: Stay away from things THAT'S Not Funny!
T-Rex: Yes!

T-Rex: I was inspired by a LITERAL nightmare I'd had the previous night... where I ate a whole bag of bread on purpose. 
Utahraptor: Laughing in manga is for chubbles and for being made of crude shapes and numbers.
T-Rex: Thank you!  I am, indeed, a kawaii-chaesis.

T-Rex: I've tried to be a good bro by having a good time! And when I'm good I try to make everyone laugh too!
T-Rex: I'm sorry!
T-Rex: I was just being serious.
