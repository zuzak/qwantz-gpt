T-Rex: If I were sent a text message, I'd probably message that to ask if I could borrow a playpen!

T-Rex: The POINT is that I'd send some friggin' text back out to those dudes!!

T-Rex: It's a cool game because they get to build their own versions, and the versions they build have different graphics and feel. It would be a great way to celebrate my bold, bold vision of playpenland!
Dromiceiomimus: We're celebrating the medium by getting it to be used as a cultural icon!
T-Rex: YES. It's a great idea. Everyone who buys a copy should get a playpen!

Utahraptor: So what's in it, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Playpen is just a fanciful name for a game where you can punch a hole in the ground or whatever!

T-Rex: It's just, once you get used to it, that it becomes - really hard to get used to. When you get old you can play it on your own, with the goal of making it sound exciting but WITHOUT the sort of EDUTRONIC explosions that would follow that first fun game.

T-Rex: I call them "fun play games". Utahraptor, they're like - games?
Utahraptor: They're like those old Nintendo titles you have in your original box.
T-Rex: Fun box games!!
T-Rex: They're fun box games! WE HAVE TO GO.
