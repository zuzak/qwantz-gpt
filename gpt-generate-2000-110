T-Rex: Stay focused, though, and you might become TOTALLYICONENT!

T-Rex: And if you're not writing well, you might appear to be stuck! Classiness! Controversy!
Dromiceiomimus: Can I get in on this action?
T-Rex: There's no shame in that!

Utahraptor: So what's the solution?
T-Rex: Fun!

T-Rex: Be awesome? Raise your hand if you did something amazing, donate a cent, whatever. It's fun for the crazy person, but also kind of weird for the normal person. Donate a cent and let's do it.
Utahraptor: I think we both agree this is the right solution.

T-Rex: I AM A LITTLE ETHICAL
