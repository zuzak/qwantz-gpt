T-Rex: When Shakespeare first spoke to his son, Hamlet, it was as a son asking him to pick a song he'd written for him. It was this song called "The House That Prowled Over Snow" and it was terrible. It was sad. It was pitch black.

T-Rex: The moral of the song was, "You don't know Hamlet".

T-Rex: It turns out Shakespeare had a son, who he said wrote for him. It turns out Hamlet was called "The House That Prowled Over Snow" because the sky was covered in flies.
Dromiceiomimus: Shakespeare had a son named "Horned by the Holy Ghost of Christmas".
T-Rex: It turns out that's the moral at play here, Dromiceiomimus!

Utahraptor: Or the "You don't know Shakespeare".
T-Rex: Or, actually, both are wrong!

T-Rex: The moral at play is that Hamlet only spoke to his son for a little while, until Hamlet decided to just ignore him and write some better plays. Either that, I think, was Shakespeare's son.
Utahraptor: Or, more specifically, that's why Hamlet didn't speak to his son for a while.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!
T-Rex: Shakespeare, you're forgetting something! I'm sorry, Shakespeare!
Shakespeare: can't we all just agree that Hamlet is WORST as a story?
T-Rex: Possibly?
