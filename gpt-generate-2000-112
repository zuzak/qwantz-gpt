T-Rex: Folks say you should talk to a psychotherapist; I say you should talk to a psychotherapist!

T-Rex: In their opinion, your mind is not as stable as it should be!

T-Rex: Not saying this, dear friend, is an challenge. Rather, I would begin by reassuring you that your mind is as stable as possible and that any changes over time will be gradual and will be gradual.
T-Rex: [[thinking]] maybe it is not always that stable. maybe after a few weeks I will notice changes and wonder. maybe my mind will start to change again and ask for more time. maybe even THIS.

Utahraptor: Wait - maybe you just got burned for not talking to a psychotherapist?
T-Rex: Nope!

T-Rex: That's what I'm going to continue. In the future, I will be adding to your mental illness by helping you forget your troubles. Your only hope is the power to change them, by learning how to change your lives.
Utahraptor: That's a pretty powerful story, my good buddy!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Today I learned how to change my life and NAME.
T-Rex: That's OK.
T-Rex: That's a good story.
