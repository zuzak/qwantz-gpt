T-Rex: Okay, so I'm not a fan of the Agents of SHIELD.  They're fighting a special government conspiracy to keep our world from spinning out of control!

T-Rex: Agents: SHIELD / The Good Wife / Agents of SHIELD: REAL LIFE??

T-Rex: But they're ALSO not going to leave your kid on the couch for five minutes saying "Oh, Agents of SHIELD.  We can do this." Agents: S.H.I.E.L.D. / Horizon, The Voice of SHIELD / etc., which also means SHORTLY EXTREMELY LITERALLY LATER.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm not a fan of Agents: T.V.A.R.U.L.F.
T-Rex: FINE.

Utahraptor: I'm a fan of Agents: spin offs as big as your house, THAT is!
T-Rex: YES.

T-Rex: And they're not doing a single justice which I found slightly over-egged the Agents themselves.
Utahraptor: I'm a fan of Agents: spin offs as big as your couch, THAT is.
T-Rex: And they're not doing a single thing in particular justice which I found quite oddly.

T-Rex: I'm a fan of everything!
T-Rex: I don't know what to call it!
T-Rex: CALLING IT "The Best Vocaloid Vocaloid Released".
