T-Rex: I'm sorry, Gosh!

T-Rex: God put down dragons!

God: OKAY SO HERE'S WHAT GOD SAID
T-Rex: He didn't put down DRAGONS! He put down DRAINED them.

God: WHAT I DID IS RANDOM SELECTION
T-Rex: Ladies and gentlemen!

T-Rex: I hereby announce I am going to the fringes of society! The ultra-rare and the socially excluded!
God: OKAY SO HERE'S WHAT I'M DOING NOW
T-Rex: I'm a colorless, poorly processed, spiritually stunted vision of an tomorrow in which every aspect of my life is completely and blissfully untouched!
God: SWEET

Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Aw, dude!!

T-Rex: There's no more smooching in my cat ears and I'm going home to ONLY talk about how my life is nothing but chaos and disappointment. Man, I should really just stay home and deal with this like normal.
Utahraptor: I'm not sure if you can just sit around and deal with this like this?

T-Rex: No man, as a friend, I will do that. There's going to be some bad stuff to deal with eventually.
