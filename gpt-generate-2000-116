T-Rex: One day Aladdin was going to go to the fair where everyone wanted to go to the fair. So he and Hamlet were going to go to the fair, but everyone stopped them there.

T-Rex: So what happened?

T-Rex: So they went to the fair and got some presents but when they arrived they were all gone. So after they got their stuff they went back to their own little worlds and grew increasingly frustrated with each other, until eventually they decided they had reached an agreement with Aladdin not to tell anyone about it.
Dromiceiomimus: So it was this amazing, constant struggle between them?
T-Rex: Oh! So Aladdin decided to just keep his options open.

T-Rex: He could go to the fair in a princess elixir or he could go to the fair in a manoeuver made of his bestselling books. 
Utahraptor: And then?

T-Rex: He decided to keep his options open. 
Utahraptor: And then everything magically went away.
T-Rex: Okay, great, but imagine if... the magic didn't exist anymore?
Utahraptor: What magic?
T-Rex: WHAT MAGIC??

Narrator: SOON: 
T-Rex: Aw man, is it me OR IS IT...
T-Rex: [[thinking]] YO WRONG
