T-Rex: Oh crap! does he have a sledgehammer?

T-Rex: Whoah, so he wasn't a dude who punches other dudes!!

T-Rex: So this means that Utahraptor has to deal with an old realization: screw you, he's not a dude who punches other dudes!!
T-Rex: And the solution's obvious: replace him with a grappling hook!!
T-Rex: Oh man!
T-Rex: Great!!

Utahraptor: But then what happens is if you punch a dude, you're causing his momentum to be taken away, and he'll end up being whipped around by a terrible giant machete!
T-Rex: Oh man!

T-Rex: SO AWESOME!!
Utahraptor: Okay, so what if I punch a MAN and he punches me?
T-Rex: How would that work out well?

T-Rex: I dunno. I'm probably better now. I don't know!
