Narrator: "THE STORY OF O"CLOCK" - by me, T-REX
T-Rex: O, I have had the greatest adventure of my life.  I am an amazing man, and a part of the reason why I am here is that I found a home here.  And -

T-Rex: - in a land of freedom and opportunity!

T-Rex: - so I got to learn so much about this amazing place of ours!  I was so shocked when I opened the fridge last night that I forgot to take it out when I came home!  I'll say it sincerely when I drink a glass of brandy.  It was a big night for me.

Utahraptor: T-Rex, this is an amazing tale of adventure and hope!
T-Rex: It is!

Utahraptor: It's full of people who went places they didn't intend to, and there's people who hid things or didn't return warnings that say "TRY ALL US, IF YOU GO AWAY FROM THE ROOM YOU ARE SINISTER TO PEOPLE X"
T-Rex: Yeah, that's true.  That's crazy!

T-Rex: Anyway, I guess I have to go back to bed now then.
T-Rex: I woke up the next morning saying "Finally, y'all!  I definitely need to learn more about my place of origin".
T-Rex: [[thinking]] yeah probably won't be hard; it'll be fun
