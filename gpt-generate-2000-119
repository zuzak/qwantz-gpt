T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate way to be totally invisible. Everyone out there thinks I'm invisible because I stay in all sorts of places! They say "Oh, hello, invisible T-Rex!" but I can't say ANYTHING without sounding like a complete jerk!

T-Rex: Guys! This is a problem we can all solve together!

T-Rex: I propose we all move to the beautiful island of Baffin!
T-Rex: It's got a fantastic view!
T-Rex: Hey, how's Baffin?
T-Rex: Pretty neat, huh?
T-Rex: Pretty WOULD YOU KNOW

Utahraptor: I'm not sure that I'm the best one to pick, T-Rex!
T-Rex: You're my friend, of course!

T-Rex: I'll say what I think: that's the best I can do.
Utahraptor: You - you should go.
T-Rex: I can't!
Utahraptor: You can stay?
T-Rex: HAH HAH!
T-Rex: WHAT
