Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS
Narrator: today's technique: THE LONG AND WESOME WEDDING
T-Rex: Long and hard, actually!

T-Rex: Okay! Okay. Let's say you've got a terrible case of the stomach flu. Say again, "Near-identical to the stomach flu I got yesterday, but maybe slightly higher."
T-Rex: "Here's another stomach flu, and I got this one."

Utahraptor: And you're not currently planning on treating the bad stomach flu.
T-Rex: Please!

T-Rex: The only way I can be 100% certain of this is if I go back to yesterday and say the last sentence of this sentence again. But I can't do that NOW, when there's no chance of me getting better.
Utahraptor: What if you were planning to take this route?
T-Rex: Impossible! Impossible.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND
T-Rex: Shakespeare, is it terrible to say "I never knew spring was such a great thing to have a terrible name"?
Shakespeare: t-rex what's it called, shortpants?
T-Rex: T-rex?
T-Rex: It's the short name "Letters to my wife" and short pants?
T-Rex: Ladies, would you say I wear those short pants if I ever go up to a good friend's wedding.
