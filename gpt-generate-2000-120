T-Rex: I am a guy who is great at say whatever I want, but who also has great interpersonal skills.

T-Rex: I think I might be a person who is great at whatever I want, but who also has great interpersonal skills.

T-Rex: Okay, so I want some, okay?  Okay, I also want some who are at least 18 years old and have not had a disagreement with anyone for some time longer than I did before.
Dromiceiomimus: Okay, but like - hang with me.  I'll see you in person.
T-Rex: That's cool, I got your back.

Utahraptor: Are you looking for some old girlfriends, T-Rex?
T-Rex: No, I've got some new girlfriends.

T-Rex: But I've also got some who are at least 20 years old and have not had any disagreements with anyone for any time longer than I did before.  So, um, I'm looking for new girlfriends.
Utahraptor: Good!  Good.  Now!
T-Rex: Good!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I had some new girlfriends, guys!!
T-Rex: They were good!
