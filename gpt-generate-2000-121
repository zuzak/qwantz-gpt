T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate foolproof way to be totally invisible. Oh MAN!!

T-Rex: How? Easy!

T-Rex: He's invisible for the rest of us. He's invisible for us AND us T-Rex.
T-Rex: So, Utahraptor! Here's my secret: I can be invisible when moving, when talking to someone, when I'm standing still and my voice isn't generating sound, and when I'm looking directly into space.
Utahraptor: Can't you see a few millimeters around you?
T-Rex: I can, by making sure I stay within a few millimeters of everything!

Narrator: SOON
T-Rex: So! When I look directly into space, do I make things look nice? Absolutely.
Utahraptor: I'm pretty nice to look at, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Really? Yep!

T-Rex: HAH HAH! So rad, eh? Looks like we're both making some progress!
