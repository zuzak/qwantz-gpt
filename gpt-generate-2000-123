Narrator: ASK PROFESSOR SCIENCE
T-Rex: Our first letter comes from "Chuggy G", who writes:

T-Rex: "Dear Professor Science: all particles are the wave function, which means if we go back in time, we can expect to find this wave function in our universe (as we do every particle of the wave function)!
T-Rex: As a matter of fact, yes."
T-Rex: It's true.

T-Rex: Anyway, our next letter comes from "Clayton Pate", writes "Me!", and writes "We've never actually been to the future, but we've been making friends and stuff since grade 2. We kinda have this little thing called '2Pumped Out of A Classroom T-Rex.' "
Dromiceiomimus: What does the future have to do with 2Pumped Out of A Classroom T-Rex?
T-Rex: See, we're pretty much the only ones that got there first.

Utahraptor: "The future"?
T-Rex: The future is where we make our final pledges as to what the universe will be like in 100 years.

T-Rex: Except for one thing...
T-Rex: ...the future will have sentient machines. T-Rex: They're -
T-Rex: ...they're sentient.
T-Rex: They'll be able to direct our actions. T-Rex: They'll be able to predict our future.
T-Rex: They'll make sure our future is as happy as possible!
