T-Rex: Dudes!  The phrase "does not equal one" applies to me!

T-Rex: I am not one of those people!!

T-Rex: And I would like to be one of those people, but I'm worried that I'm too clear on the word.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm worried that you're not a half-baked philosophical analysis, allowing the logical conclusion to be shaped by the language of the passive observer!
T-Rex: Sorry? I rely on my passive understanding of the world being real and my passive understanding of the phrase "does not equal one" being an accurate and concise description.

Utahraptor: But how precisely do you define "does not equal one"?
T-Rex: Oh, simply saying "does not equal one".

T-Rex: A metaphor is just a metaphor that pops into your head when you realize you don't understand what the speaker is saying.  Is it "Does not equal one" or "Does not equal one"?  The words are like "Did you know that the speaker of this sentence is a mute?"
Utahraptor: ...

Utahraptor: ...I mean, I mean.  It doesn't equal "I did not hear, but it is a fact"
T-Rex: Please.  I'm unconscious.  Anyway, the metaphor is "Does not equal one" and I was just trying to figure out how to be unconscious about things.
T-Rex: I had a crazy plan!  The people behind SCIENCE ITSELF are pretty mad at me.

God: T-REX ITS A WISE MAN
T-Rex: He says, "You wake up in a room with a music machine playing 'The Gambler" every eight minutes!
Man: WE WENT DOWN TO THE RECEPTION AREA
T-Rex: WE KICK THE ROOM
