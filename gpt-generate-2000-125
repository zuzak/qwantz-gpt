T-Rex: I think that the greatest proof that time travel isn't possible is that we're not overrun by now! We're running around the clock, saving people's lives for sure.

T-Rex: But I can't prove time travel is possible!

T-Rex: Time travellers have invented absolutely nothing, and we're just getting started. But I can at least prove time travel is possible. I'll demonstrate it by doing experiments!
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, this is a very pressing concern!
T-Rex: Our last words will be "T-Rex, you saved our lives!"

Utahraptor: Experimentations?
T-Rex: Sure, but the point is, any experiments we do will have to be recorded and used to build a computer so we can travel to this future and save people's lives, and get them back before it's destroyed.

T-Rex: Experimentations are important!
Utahraptor: But not mandatory!
T-Rex: Okay, fine, OBVIOUSLY. We've got to do experiments.
T-Rex: We're gonna need a time machine.
Utahraptor: That'll take us from here and back in time, and make us the smartest and most perfect being thus far.

T-Rex: That's not an amazing premise!
