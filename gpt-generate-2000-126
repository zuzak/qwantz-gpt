T-Rex: Today is the day I bought some presents for my friends! They sure are tricked asides in when they get a gift card for... a chocolate bar!

T-Rex: ...which is a true confession.

T-Rex: I was seriously going to say "true confession", but now that I think about it I'm not!
T-Rex: I bought a chocolate bar and some presents AND ran out of money!

T-Rex: My friends were then assured of a very specific present, however, that present was something special.
Utahraptor: And special enough to make you fall in love with your friends?

T-Rex: Okay, but that present was something new for a reason!
T-Rex: Like the fact that it was something NEW for me.

T-Rex: And the present was something different, but inside me -
Utahraptor: T-Rex!
T-Rex: Oh SUCK it's not here let me get lost
