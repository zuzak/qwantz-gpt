T-Rex: I have some bad news: my favourite musician is gone!  I had better be right, BABY.

T-Rex: I have decided to make a list of people I like because they are great!

T-Rex: I could call this list, "The Great Gatsby's Billy List".
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, there you are, someone's heard of you and they think I'm a snob!
T-Rex: THEY WOULD BE FRIENDS. I WILL BE THERE.

Utahraptor: But you're leaving, are you? Are you going to come over tonight to play music with us?
T-Rex: They won't be showing up!

T-Rex: I will be back tonight, stand up, and tell them we're not interested! They'll be mad, and then they'll all be wrong.
Utahraptor: I don't think that's going to happen.
T-Rex: Oh yeah? Well they sure will.

Narrator: THE END
Narrator: P.S.: I COULD USE MY OUTSIDE THE GROUND PRIVATE REMEMBERING HOW I COULD MAKE A BIG DEEP HOOK
