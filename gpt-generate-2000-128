T-Rex: Alright dudes! Today is the day I finally pass the day I get paid.

T-Rex: YES I TOTALLY DID.

T-Rex: I'm finally getting enough of this roof I have standing up and going to bed. I'm getting some shapely legs so I can run around and hide amongst the dense bushes. I've got a suitcase full of bad things to say about today!
Dromiceiomimus: Huh?
T-Rex: Yeah I got it, Dromiceiomimus!

Utahraptor: Hey T-Rex, what's the deal here, huh?
T-Rex: Oh, the deal?

Utahraptor: Yeah it's that! You're supposed to impress your friends with your size and figure and look little danged, just because of your small age?
T-Rex: I didn't! I mean, I aged. I was young and alright!
Utahraptor: Okay, listen, I uh - I dunno.

Narrator: LATER, T-REX PUBLISHES "TOO BIG INGE AND HANDY FEET GIRL" HAD BEEN WRITTEN OUT AND REMAINS BOARD FEET, WHILE ALSO SUSPICING BABIES AND PUP PANS YET WEAK AND FUNNY WITH BABY LANGUAGE ACTIVITIES
T-Rex: My problem is plural nouns, "made" and "kind" being singular and the other without any gender!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: I can make that!
