T-Rex: I've been thinking, and I've come up with the perfect solution to the problem of my being considered, by others, to be "pretty okay"!

T-Rex: I'll define okay as the situation being one step away from catastrophe - a few inches of snow stripping us all from the face of the planet, but two pebbles under our seat of rule, so we may each other -
T-Rex: Another pebble under my bum!

Utahraptor: I'm with you, T-Rex! On this, I accept

T-Rex: But before you go any further, let me say a SEC. an awful word about you or a few words about how we could better ourselves, a few words about ten minutes before you're all going to die about to you, and a few words about whether we're ever going to fully understand each other. 
Utahraptor: A few words?
T-Rex: NO

T-Rex: I'm going to be... pretty okay?
T-Rex: Five stars!
