T-Rex: I am a man who, despite my best efforts, still has problems with being a man!

T-Rex: Rebekah and Ryan are two members of my gender, and as such, they deserve better.

T-Rex: But it's the "bro" who gets to define who I am! He has to pay taxes. Kathleen and Antonio and Jane Klebold and others who do manly things like "kick and lean" and "sex the same as sex" all get a little more "in" status. My brothers define myself by my sexy times!
Dromiceiomimus: They don't define who I am.
T-Rex: Huh! It seems they're all trying to please their male pal and yet... they're not ALL trying to please me.

T-Rex: They all just want some prostate-inhibiting drugs!
Utahraptor: Huh?

T-Rex: They want some research funding and PR dollars and all sorts of other non-therapeutic means to make me prostate-inhibiting drugs!
Utahraptor: Dude, you define yourself by your problems! Not by your "problematic problems".
T-Rex: Problematic problems!!

T-Rex: Why does everyone keep having my prostate-inhibiting drugs? They're like prostate-inhibiting buttazoos, except the problems with that are so great that it's ridiculous.
T-Rex: Why is everyone keeping such attractive but undesirable partners?
T-Rex: Why does everyone keep such underinformed, low-performance personal finance decisions?
