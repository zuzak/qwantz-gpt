Narrator: THE DAY DROMICEIOMIMUS INVITED PEOPLE TO A PARTY TOO EARLY
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus invited me to his party three nights in a row!  I was totally cool!

T-Rex: The first party was really nice, because it was a straight white wedding, and the second was a "prince panel".  The third was a panel that talked about MY awesome body!
Dromiceiomimus: "T-Rex is so awesome!"
T-Rex: That's true!

T-Rex: The last party I went to was a giant open house where everyone talked about the awesome power of music!
Utahraptor: WEIRD

Utahraptor: WEIRD!
T-Rex: "We just want good food!!"  shouted everyone else!
Utahraptor: WELL THEN.

T-Rex: "The food weunch are just another group of people who like to talk about their feelings and get good advice," I'd said.  "We should talk about feelings better than we do.  We'll be less religious about it."
T-Rex: "I told you we'd be worse," said Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: MY KISSING HANDSOME HANDSAPTOR ACTUALLY KEEPS

Off Panel: "God on TV," said T-Rex!
T-Rex: Hah hah!  What?
T-Rex: God's KISSING swordsap!
