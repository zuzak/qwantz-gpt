T-Rex: The year is 1994, and the entire planet is BURNING DOWN A HERNIA.  You watch cartoons as the plane heads towards your house!

T-Rex: You can FEEL it too, Dromiceiomimus! You can feel it right now - THE POWER OF THE GRAVE.  You turn and see the smoke billowing from the sun, and you're not only enuffed, but also DEATHBOLD.  You turn and run for the hills, but everyone ELSE ELSE is watching!  You're not alone: every second that passes is Counted.

T-Rex: We gotta find you a match!
Utahraptor: My friend, I can't believe you're still here!

T-Rex: But you're gonna DIE.  Go to bed, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: I can, but I'd better get moving!  I'd better get REGRETless.
T-Rex: Okay, here we go!

T-Rex: Desperate times call for desperate measures!  But you...
Utahraptor: I'll catch the plane.  I'll get out of here before it crashes.
T-Rex: You'll save us all, Utahraptor!

T-Rex: My final words to Desperate Measures are "I'M not going anywhere!".  You'll be right back, Utahraptor!  And the sky's the limit!
Utahraptor: I still think maybe you should T-Rex be my roommate, T-Rex
