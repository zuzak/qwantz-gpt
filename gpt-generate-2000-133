T-Rex: Let's say you're down 5 HP, and that you're trying to eat something. You throw away the food and everything inside your body dies. All your remaining HP has been eaten by the falling corpses of those you lost inside you!

T-Rex: But that's not a terribly plausible scenario!

T-Rex: It builds towards the end, and you start to feel a little more and you think, "Maybe I've just dropped 5 HP", but then the implausible nature of this feeling dawns on you: maybe you've just dropped 5 HP. Or maybe you've just dropped 5 HP, and suddenly everyone inside you is like "Oh, my gosh! This guy is doing it wrong!"

Utahraptor: Maybe you're not that unusual with this sort of thing!
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: But perhaps... Perhaps we're here as a thing to reassess each other?
Utahraptor: Well, no, not necessarily: we just feel differently about how we absorb and remember events, and -
T-Rex: - you shouldn't be alarmed because 5 HP is definitely not a very practical drop.

T-Rex: But I for one would not mind!
T-Rex: [[Thinking back to earlier part]] Think about what you'd do if you had a friend who lost 5 HP!
