T-Rex: One day, a group of teens decided that they were doing something NEW. They decided that they were going to be a --

T-Rex: -- which meant they'd got to mix up puberty with some period stuff.

T-Rex: This was weird, because I was the one who was bringing up Jane Austen and Persephone and all that.  I wanted to pull them out!  I don't now but when I see a picture of a girl with a bowler hat on, it makes me feel a lot more like they're MY age than real Austen fans would like.
Dromiceiomimus: Do you want to pull Austen out?
T-Rex: What?  Of all the books to be published in the world, definitely overstepping their mark!

Utahraptor: You can't just pull off that sort of thing with your own writing!
T-Rex: I know, and that's why I'm so excited for Teen androids, Teen androids!

T-Rex: The coolest androids will be those with the most words, and when they're words, they're ABSOLUTELY NARRATIVE.  Stories with no emotional undertone will be the most delectable.  And the saddest stories will be those with the sad but sincere message that has become the universal cultural value of the silent and the brooding.

T-Rex: It's going to be SO AWESOME.
