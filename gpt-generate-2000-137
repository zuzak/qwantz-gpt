T-Rex: I am a guy who has enough of my "me too" theories. It's time to let the things that make me tickle those instincts fly in the family!

T-Rex: I propose an experiment that will change my life and the world around me!

T-Rex: I will build my own powerful device that will make me tickle a specific emotion!  I will give it secondary fang, giving it a more sinister, sinister feel.  I will wear it to protect my delicate feelings!
Dromiceiomimus: I think it'll work ? I dunno . . . maybe not really.
T-Rex: Whatever, I've got all the necessary ingredients. I'm down to experiment.

Utahraptor: I propose a robot that will tickle both the flesh and the machine guns in even more sinister ways!
T-Rex: Exactly my definition of "sexy"!

T-Rex: I will add a "force" that will make any flesh activity become sexual.  I will coerce my machine into fulfilling my sexual desires . . . in a way that is sure to come across as - sometimes sensual?
Utahraptor: I've got a phrase though, I dunno.
T-Rex: I have no idea WHAT you're doing!

T-Rex: I'm sort of cheating at life though, you know ?
T-Rex: "Sexual instincts manifest in all sorts of things, including things that are attractive but aren't sexy enough to warrant sexual satisfaction."  That's a bit harder than it seems.
