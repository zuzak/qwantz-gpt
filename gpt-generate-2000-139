T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate way to be happy. Everyone tries it and has EVERYTHING GOES NOR WORSTESTLY MYSELF.

T-Rex: Now I only ever use the most egregious misplacing of words!

T-Rex: But you could also be happy being the ultimate friend, by remembering that you only value the things you can love, and that knowing that you can do that is possible only if you love the things you're willing to give for my love.
Dromiceiomimus: And if you're sad, you could be happy being sad, too.
T-Rex: Oh, I get it.
T-Rex: I'm the ultimate friend!

Utahraptor: I think it's actually kinda dumb that we all equate friendship with SELF-PALKS
T-Rex: I know!

T-Rex: But it's not! I mean, it's the opposite! I think it's pretty dumb that we all equate friendship with PALKS.
Utahraptor: Oh?
T-Rex: Oh, I don't know...

T-Rex: I think maybe it's important to remember that friendship isn't just about who gets to kiss whom, it's also about who gets to set the mood, and also about whom - 
T-Rex: Who? 
T-Rex: Who gets to kiss whom.
