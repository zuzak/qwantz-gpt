T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate foolproof way to win lottery dollars!

T-Rex: Every time I want to win a dollar, I just pay the person the lottery dollars for my turn. Then I pay the person every time they want to buy me something. Sometimes I even pay them through online gambling sites. Dromiceiomimus, do you think people would play online game casinos? If yes, I don't know I'd play it for real.
Dromiceiomimus: I -
T-Rex: But I don't have a slot machine.

Utahraptor: You already have a machine at a specialty level, T-Rex!
T-Rex: But I've invented one!

T-Rex: It's the precise same hardware-as-machine combination, but with all the basics getting out of hand. When you program a computer to do something, it'll ask you for a certain amount of money, and you'll tell it you're serious about that. But when you run your computer through some brief thought test it won't take your money or even your answer correctly, and when you ask it to do the same thing it won't. Will it? T-Rex: Not really!

Utahraptor: Programming computers to take money is an interesting problem - the Utahraptor's Computer Science is a must.
T-Rex: I know!
T-Rex: And the answer is yes, we are very clever!
