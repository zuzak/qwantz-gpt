T-Rex:  So the average adult is supposed to think about sex like, a billion times a day, right? Sometimes more? 

T-Rex:  ...Especially if they're bored?

T-Rex:  Well I'm going to be ABOVE-average, Dromiceiomimus, and I don't mean I'm going to think about sex two billion times per day!  Instead, I'm going to think really productive thoughts instead of sexy ones.  Instead of thoughts about how cute they are, I'm going to think productive thoughts instead of sexy ones.
Dromiceiomimus: So let's design a truly ADULT system, you know?
T-Rex:  Oh? Okay! Let's do it this weekend!

Utahraptor: You've got this week off, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I've got to think sexy thoughts, quiet and productive!

T-Rex: I've got to think productive thoughts in bed, where they become productive thoughts instead of sexy ones, which is a problem the rest of us can solve together.
Utahraptor: I don't know - maybe make a special "Think productive thoughts instead of sexy ones" dessert?

T-Rex: I don't know! Maybe bring some fruit juice in!
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: It's gonna be really interesting
