T-Rex: I have a friend who went from friendship to real break.  First, he chewed a bit, then bit more, and then bit by bit? MORE? Eventually the friendship was cut short by a heart attack, and doctors removed him from the diet.

T-Rex: He's a good doctor, I promise it!

T-Rex: But then he started to notice that sometimes when his friends needed him more than a few days a week, they wouldn't.  He noticed they were spending more time with him in hospital and he worried that the extra time would make them not want him anymore.
Dromiceiomimus: What could possibly go wrong?
T-Rex: What could possibly go wrong?

Utahraptor: The only way to stop this is to make it SO HARD.
T-Rex: Too hard for him, Utahraptor!

T-Rex: We've tried to make it so if he needs it most, but if he doesn't need it most, then it might as well be more.  We've simply got to give him the help he needs.
Utahraptor: That's not a philosophy...
T-Rex: ...We've just got to -
T-Rex: WAIT A MINUTE

{{title text: FOR EXAMPLE, if you want a friend to buy you some presents, you might want to check with the person you're inviting them to dinner with.  They'll likely want you for dinner that evening.  Don't be ridiculous}}
