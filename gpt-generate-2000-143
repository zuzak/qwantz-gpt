T-Rex: I am a dude who is great in all situations, positive or negative! In situations of social disarray! In situations of social disarray, I yell "Welcome to the world!" and others say "Oh wow T-Rex, you've just doubled your points pool!"

T-Rex: I do this because I like to keep up with the times!

T-Rex: In my most recent example, I got a text message that said "New pet! Amazing." That's the perfect text message! It's so amazing! People now say "New pet!" all the time.
Dromiceiomimus: What are people saying all the time?
T-Rex: I am always EITHER the best or worst!

Utahraptor: What are you doing?
T-Rex: I was thinking of extending the meaning of messages out over TIME, and of developing a new word for it: "Time".

Utahraptor: Well, maybe the new word has some cultural context, huh?
T-Rex: It DOESN'T matter what people think now, because we're all still the same.
Utahraptor: We've got STANDARD English language usage.
T-Rex: And ALSO, we're all just dudes!

God: THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD TALKED TONIGHT
God: ACTUALLY
God: TALKING LIKE YOU DO
