T-Rex: So, as I was saying, there's a certain tension between the two main characters:

T-Rex: They're two people living together, but they're also people of many different views, different linguistic and religious beliefs.

T-Rex: This tension shows up in the story they're telling, where they're taking a bus to visit a doctor instead.
Dromiceiomimus: Do you feel this way about believing in a particular god?
T-Rex: I feel WAY more comfortable if I know both god and god-man are getting along!

Utahraptor: I don't believe that's true, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I KNOW that it is!

Utahraptor: You're going to read my mind-set and you'll realize that it's ridiculous!
T-Rex: I'm going to believe in both!
Utahraptor: Yeah, but believe in either a non-God or a God-Again!

Narrator: THAT NIGHT:
God-Again(Not Really Me) (Not Really Me)
