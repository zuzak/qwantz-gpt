Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear old me, I had a dream last night where I was TOTALLY NARRATIVE.  So let's take a minute to talk about something new!

T-Rex: Let's do it by transcribing the lines of my dream together!

T-Rex: Okay so in this dream I'm at the computer and I have this line that says "Hey.  imagine if there was a giant computer at the centre of the screen?" and then the dream cuts off and I have this other line that says "Finally!  Imagine the conversation in a box."  And suddenly I've translated the line back into my head perfectly.
Dromiceiomimus: But doesn't the computer make the other decisions?
T-Rex: Nope! It doesn't!

Utahraptor: So what happens when I get to the centre of the screen?
T-Rex: Okay, it cuts off all communication with the dream computer, and then I'm trapped in a box!

T-Rex: Anyway! I get to the centre of the screen and I talk to the giant, and then he cuts off all my contact with the dream computer.  PEACE OUT, BABY.  I'm trapped in the box.
Utahraptor: You didn't even break the box!
T-Rex: It's not that big of a deal, actually

T-Rex: I keep forgetting to flip the switch, but the dream computer suddenly walks right into my friend who I think is great, and who I've yet to meet a real-life crush on.  We're doing battle outside, Utahraptor.  It's going to be SO AWESOME.
T-Rex: And it's getting so great.
T-Rex: I'm reliving the same dream last night where I imagined the dream computer did something WAY better, but which somehow AGAIN seems pretty dumb.  T-Rex: I'm reliving my worst nightmare.
