T-Rex: After a heady shower of - surprise! - surprise! ride-hails filled with water, I am found by helicopter the next morning!

T-Rex: I make my first landing under water and am instantly Earth-shorn!

T-Rex: I am utterly dour and - surprise! - everyone around me looks on as I steel myself for the face of an upright biped. I can see the top of the hill but really don't see anything but water, and yet, I'm utterly shivering.
T-Rex: I keep on Climbing!
Utahraptor: You're not using your elbows as a breathing aid!
T-Rex: No, but that's a great idea!

T-Rex: I'm getting down to business. Now everybody knows we're trying this!
Utahraptor: Then we can start suffusing our bodies with water-based delectable liquid soap!
T-Rex: It's not a business!  I just don't want to be the guy who poops.

T-Rex: I will, happily, learn my mountaineering lesson!
T-Rex: The river bank is home to many life's challenges: the shifting oceanic life that made up my body in the first place, the countless corpses of millions that drowned as a direct result of the Earth's relentless beating and ocean's current, etc...
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: Okay.
