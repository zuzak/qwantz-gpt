T-Rex:  Hello!  I have some good news!  We're creating life on the moon!

T-Rex:  I don't know why you're praising us, but we're still on the moon!

T-Rex:  We're literally there, ALTHOUGH WE COULD LOG ON INSIDE THE MALL.  That's some planet!
T-Rex:  On another moon, we could land!
T-Rex:  I'm serious!  We could land for really, REALLY, REALLY interesting extended periods of time without the need for a backcountry trip!

Utahraptor:  So what?
T-Rex:  Lonely, efficient exploration of the moon's (and perhaps other) moonless sky becomes commercialized!

T-Rex:  That's a good thing, Utahraptor.  We can do it business as usual.
Utahraptor:  I don't see any advantages to land and tourism in the moonless sky!
T-Rex:  Mines become swamps!  Wastes become deserts!

Narrator:  LATER, IN THE MOON:
T-Rex:  It's a beautiful day!
