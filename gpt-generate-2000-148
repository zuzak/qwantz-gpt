Narrator: COMPRESSED ORIGIN STORY COMICS
T-Rex: I have finally written my own origin story!  It's about a man and a woman who meet at a party and fall in love!

T-Rex: But there's a catch!  They also have to fight all the other women who have started dating after them!

T-Rex: They fall in love with each other, but it's more than that.  They fall in love with each other, but each is more than she realizes.  Finally, they fall in love again, but this time for almost no reason.
T-Rex: It's the end of romance??

Utahraptor: So the man finally falls in love with the woman, but has been abandoned by his wife.
T-Rex: Oh yeah??

T-Rex: The woman wakes up and realizes it's because of ME, and the only thing holding her together is the knowledge that he loves her.  A counsellor tells her to keep her promises and let him stay at home.  But then he starts getting naked pictures of his freshly shaved balls, and she knows it.  She's lost his touch.  She starts crying.

T-Rex: Oh well! OR IS THAT...
T-Rex: THE END??
