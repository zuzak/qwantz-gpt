T-Rex: If you're going to write a book, you need a story. If I were writing a book about walking down the street into a museum, I wouldn't want to take the bus because that would be rude. Instead, I'd just walk up to the front desk and say "Hey, nice to meet you, [that fellow here]", and then I'm sure I'll be impressed enough to pay the man not to leave me alone. But I can't do that if I'm not going to write the story. I need a different format!

T-Rex: Okay, so the story starts out and it's about a man walking down the street, wearing a walking shirt.
T-Rex: HE LEFTS HIS WORD WORD MONEY THERE.

Dromiceiomimus: "He leaves his word alone"?
T-Rex: Exactly! So the narrator is this stoic man-wolf walking down the street, but he also has this OTHER WORD in the WORD "liberated". So the story uses the English word "liberated" to mean "liberated from the shackles of the shackLE!" and not "liberated from the shackled shackLE that is you!"
T-Rex: Man, if I were all this interested in learning more about FREE WILL I'd come back here tonight!

Utahraptor: So the story starts out this skeptic, looking for evidence that can justify his beliefs, but then he leaves the shackles of the shackLE and gets free will!
T-Rex: You're right!

T-Rex: When he meets people who have this free will, that's a chance for closure. They have this other thing in mind which is not so much free will as it is evidence. 
Utahraptor: ...Okay.
T-Rex: YES, THAT'S GREAT. I KINDA LOVE HOW THAT COMPLY WITH THE BIBLE.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary!! You know what's BIG??
T-Rex: Harvesting.
