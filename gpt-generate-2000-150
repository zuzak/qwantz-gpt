T-Rex: I'm a guy who's really good at certain things. Like... peeing in a well?

T-Rex: ...is something I've done a fair amount of times.

T-Rex: But this time, I'd actually prefer to have a well-established relationship if I had the final say!
T-Rex: I mean, I'd prefer that my partner get the final say!
T-Rex: ...Would you rather... have peeing in a well, I mean.

Utahraptor: I'd prefer that your partner get the final say!
T-Rex: Good luck with that!

T-Rex: I'm not sure that makes any sense. It's like, do I want to spend every waking hour doing this, and there's no guarantee I won't get some other sad bits going!
Utahraptor: But then you'd lose the friendship!
T-Rex: But then I guess I'd lose the friendship too!

T-Rex: Right, because it's sort of a double-end of the "You'd lose the friendship if you went to go do that if you went to go pee in the well"! The only way to avoid this is to make sure your partner gets the final say!
T-Rex: It's SORT OF SORRY, MY FRIEND!
