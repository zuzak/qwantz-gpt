T-Rex: a web card

T-Rex: the beginning of a new web card

T-Rex: So you guys read an email, and it's like, "hey guys I wonder if my virginity has been TRIED." and you're like, "hey my secret identity is being traded between equals!"
T-Rex: and the end of the email says "this card sucks and i am sorry; I am the one doing the talking".
T-Rex: by the time you read the end you've totes read the whole thing!

Utahraptor: You sure took the time to read the whole thing?
T-Rex: Yeah!

Utahraptor: Yeah!  You can't keep two people reading the same thing, especially not during rush hours!  So: new webcard format, new webcard format.
T-Rex: I'm not old!

Utahraptor: New format saves you both a page and can even read both simultaneously!
T-Rex: It's great!  I'm old and it's like "hi T-Rex; I need to go to the bathroom." But I love it!  It's like "this card says T-Rex, but I know you know already".
T-Rex: What?!  Man!
T-Rex: How did we get this far in my life being totally totally totally different?
