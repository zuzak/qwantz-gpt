T-Rex: There are a lot of metaphors I can come up with for "what is" and "what is not", I will, in due time, have become a metaphors man!

T-Rex: I will be able to say things like "The planet is not orbiting around the sun", or the phrase "What a beautiful word it contains, I salute you!"
Dromiceiomimus: Are you sure you're not able to say things like that?
T-Rex: I can!

Utahraptor: That's pretty impressive!
T-Rex: Pretty badass!

T-Rex: But you're also basically saying "Give me a rest, Utahraptor!"
Utahraptor: That's not what I'm trying to.
T-Rex: Yes, as an elder, I'm assured of that!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio,
T-Rex: Dear recipient of this comic:
T-Rex: Your heart has been corrupted and you are not entirely rational!
