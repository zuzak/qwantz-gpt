T-Rex: One day, Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive zombie and gained the ability to STATUS. It turns out that Parker had been working as a typist guy guy...for the comics!

T-Rex: Then he assumed the zombie form of a regular kid, and he kept punching things because he knew they needed protection!

T-Rex: But Spider-Man was able to avoid punching, and so he continued working as a guy guy guy. 
T-Rex: He was bitten by the zombie before it could grow wings, and by the time he got his legs it was too late. 

Utahraptor: And so he became a superhero?
T-Rex: Yes! 

T-Rex: He was a regular guy guy guy punching other regular guys!
Utahraptor: And he became the new "speedster of the new millennium" though, I guess.
T-Rex: Wait.  Wait I got that far.  This story just straight-up described how Peter ended up punching a lot of other regular dudes, and that's just because of the raven-like animal in the story! 

T-Rex: Anyway I guess I have to get back to him!
T-Rex: But I GUESS...
T-Rex: I must have been fifteen at the time!
