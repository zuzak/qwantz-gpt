T-Rex: I was born to be an awesome dinosaur.  I've got claws and toes, and they're named...

T-Rex: ...UM, LIONS.  I can punch LION and also make LIONS in all CAPS.

Dromiceiomimus: You're not great at LIONS either, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Just great at them.  I'll kick their ass!
Dromiceiomimus: Okay, you suck on the LION'S LITERATURE.  They're not allowed to heckle.
T-Rex: Okay, okay, you talk on the phone and JUST PLAY NETWORK WITH MY DICK FANS!

Utahraptor: You're not great at LIONS either, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Just great at making LIONS AND kicking LIONS!!

Utahraptor: I was there and NO THINGS HURT AT ALL, and the only thing you did was NARRATE about the awesome things they were doing with their muscles!
T-Rex: Hah!  Wow.
T-Rex: ...which was FANTASTIC.

Narrator: LATER, T-REX FEELS REGRET FOR HOW THE YEARS LATER FORWARD WERE.
T-Rex: I was just...feeling alright?
T-Rex: Wow
T-Rex: Huh
