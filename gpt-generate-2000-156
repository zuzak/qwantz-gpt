T-Rex: Hey, I have some bad news! I think that the future, to be more precise!

T-Rex: I'm a bad bet to be the first to say this, but I have some good ones to tell you.

T-Rex: For example: rather than saying things are going to be okay, I'm a) not going to be a bad bet to be, and b) having better, more consistent stories.
Dromiceiomimus: When there's some stories that are going to get flipped, you're more than likely going to want to stay home and read.
T-Rex: Hah! YES. You're right! I will be a T-Rex in this story.

Utahraptor: But T-Rex, you can't just decide to be a good bet to read every day -
T-Rex: Sure, but I WILL refuse!

Utahraptor: You're not going to read every day Batman, Sherlock Holmes, or NOW that Dromiceiomimus has invented computers that can read words, rather than telling everyone that you're a bad bet!
T-Rex: Sure, but I WILL refuse!

T-Rex: Dear mental diary I am always... ALMOST DEPRESSED NOW
