T-Rex: Okay, so we all know the power of repetition! It's why we die.

T-Rex: But MAYBE we forget that in a second there's a super killer who wants to take over the world. WE, the kids, want to be the world's greatest super super killer!!

T-Rex: So in conclusion, our story's over, Dromiceiomimus. We've all changed.
T-Rex: Awesome.
T-Rex: Seriously though, the only thing we've changed is that we're ALREADY the greatest kids. SUPER. CHICKEN. AND AWESOME.

T-Rex: Seriously though, this story could've been MUCH worse.  WE KNEW THAT.
Utahraptor: So instead we're SUPER chunky kids?
T-Rex: Yep.

T-Rex: And we defeat the ultimate ultimate ultimate ultimate. And that means the world's ENDLESS REMEDIES.  Awesomeness.  I don't know why we keep making that argument, but sometimes it works.
Utahraptor: Yeah, it's our movie!  Watch it if you want the ENDING to say "Awful".
T-Rex: The movie.
T-Rex: It's about a SUPER killer who wants to take over the world.
