T-Rex: I've written a draft of a new book!  The book is called, "How To Be Awesome".  The book details how I will be awesome, and how you can become awesome.

T-Rex: I'm super excited!

T-Rex: First, I'll be awesome enough to travel to the moon!

T-Rex: Then I'll be awesome enough to eat a whole potted plant, and then I'll be awesome enough to pee on a hot dog stand and DIE!
Dromiceiomimus: Then?
T-Rex: Finally, I'll be awesome enough to go to the moon and be totally bored!

Utahraptor: But that's not what happens!
T-Rex: That's what happens?

Utahraptor: Well, here's the plan: whenever there's a new book on the moon, I'll go on a two-week mission to look for the title and find it!
T-Rex: That means I'll be able to steal the title from an obscure charity!

Narrator: T-REX'S BATTLE FOR THE MOON
T-Rex: I'll be the unstoppable force at the core of every sentient species!
T-Rex: I'll take over the world!
