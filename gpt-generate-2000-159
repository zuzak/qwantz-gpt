T-Rex: Here's what we have to do...

T-Rex: Um, come, Dromiceiomimus?
Dromiceiomimus: Here's what we have to do...
T-Rex: Um, get a prescription?
Dromiceiomimus: Here's what we have to do...
T-Rex: Um... get some medicine to help me move my arms and lower them toward the air as I stomp, suplex, throw, slide, throw back, all the while panting and praying to the God Who GIVES ME ALL THE POWER??

Utahraptor: I think I gave you all the answers, my friend!
T-Rex: You'd give him all the answers, my friend!!

Utahraptor: ...He'd give you all the answers, my friend!!
T-Rex: *gasp*
Utahraptor: ...He'd give you all the answers, my friend!!
T-Rex: *gasp*

T-Rex: See? See? See?
T-Rex: It's all in the "question"
