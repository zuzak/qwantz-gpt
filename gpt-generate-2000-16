T-Rex: I've decided that I will dedicate ateffinitely my own life style to...

T-Rex: You know...

T-Rex: ... sports.

T-Rex: Do you mean sports where you're jumping ropes or boating?
Dromiceiomimus: I do not!
T-Rex: Then I'd lose my distinctive "but my heart is beating perfectly" look.

Utahraptor: You're running away from something?
T-Rex: Then it's too late!

Utahraptor: Oh well. Sound like you'd rather find out?
T-Rex: Oh sure! Soon!
Utahraptor: Cool.

Narrator: LATER, AT THE BAR:
T-Rex: Man, sports are for the crazy, the rare ladies, and the parties with the weird.
Dromiceiomimus: What's for dinner?
T-Rex: Oh God.
T-Rex: The Professor has my number.
