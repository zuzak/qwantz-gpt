T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate way to be loved by a billion people, everyone connected to the internet.

T-Rex: I will forever love to be loved by people who spend their time like this.

T-Rex: IMPORTANT: to love like nobody's business, knowing that nobody's watching you and that if you don't do so, the world might not find you in a few months!
Dromiceiomimus: I think we've somehow survived THIS!
T-Rex: T-That's true! To love like nobody's business, knowing that you might have a problem at work, is the vanguard of the ultimate love.

Utahraptor: That's what makes me fall in love with this guy?
T-Rex: Oh yeah? Well I've just...

T-Rex: I've always kinda wanted to find someone to hold in my arms and kiss, but it turns out I can't fall in love with someone just because they're such a small number of people I can hold in my arms.
Utahraptor: I think that romantic feelings can be tricky!

T-Rex: Oh yeah? Well you can still be loved, but only if you're particularly open to them?
Utahraptor: I guess so. I still think that's one way or the other!
T-Rex: That's right!
T-Rex: I'm still totally gonna love someone.
