T-Rex: My stars, am I ever enamoured with the Utahraptor.  He's got the ability to change his very state!

T-Rex: His entire body will appear to be frozen solid, as if he's been conscious for years!

T-Rex: His features will be noticeably different from that of a regular person, as well.  Instead of a torso, he'll be a torso with different functions!  His entire life will become a chaotic sprint, with him being at greater risk of falling than a regular person.  And this is just for starters!  He'll start to feel that "saved" cry for help, so he'll do what he can to help other people in his community.  And when that other person has nowhere to go, he'll resort to physical force to keep himself from going down.  "I'll get you a rope to help you get your food and water, T-Rex," he'll say, and then they'll all be at his mercy, the lights and the water will turn pink and the other person will yell "He's down!"

T-Rex: He'll finish by stomping into the fridge!
Utahraptor: T-Rex!

T-Rex: He's right there.  He'll decide that someone else's needs are more important, and he'll go for a regular rope to those other needs!  There, he'll rope himself to the fridge, until he accidentally tells the others to get out of their chairs so they can have ice cream instead.  When they arrive home, they'll find that the government has put them back in their chairs!

T-Rex: NICE.
T-Rex: Eventually, all the bad guys will be dead, but not before blowing themselves up in his face.
T-Rex: And then they're all pretty much all out of control!
