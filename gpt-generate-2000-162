Narrator: ASK PROFESSOR SCIENCE
T-Rex: Our first letter comes from "Chuggy G", who writes:

T-Rex: "Dear Professor Science!', you've done an awesome job so far. I'm really looking forward to the day when you get me a new computer."

T-Rex: Wow. 
T-Rex: We're almost ready to discuss this letter.
T-Rex: Dear Professor Science!
T-Rex: *sigh*

T-Rex: Well, that was kind of the point. I thought we'd both get a new computer ready as soon as possible after we talk about it.
Utahraptor: Sounds pretty reasonable!

T-Rex: I can see that. 
T-Rex: But it doesn't explain why we never get along. 
Utahraptor: What's up? 

T-Rex: Our letter to you is all "hey, maybe we should get things done first?" and we tell you that's what we're going to write. And we also say "we're gonna get things done and then some so we can GET TOTALLY done."
T-Rex: THAT'S AWESOME. 
T-Rex: And we then write "now imagine our friendship complete and ease!" and we go on to say that might be the best friend ever. 
T-Rex: LET'S GO.
