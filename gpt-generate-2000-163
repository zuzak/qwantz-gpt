T-Rex: I bet that I could be an amazing ballet dancer, if only I spent less time thinking about it and more thinking about SANTA HEADLINE, the elephant that poops its brains in a jar.

T-Rex: Oh boy! I would be unstoppable!

T-Rex: I'll save that moment from its tears, Dromiceiomimus. I'll save whenever I can. I'll save when my naughty bits get kicked out the way.
Dromiceiomimus: ...I'm looking for more time ladies.
T-Rex: T-
T-Rex: I'm looking for more time ladies!!

Utahraptor: Oh goodness, are you serious about this, T-Rex?
T-Rex: It's okay, the whole idea of the comic is that one can purchase a Patron to keep things classy.

T-Rex: But in today's modern world, Patron Certificates allow a PERSON to purchase time-delayed shipping via the post. Ouch for those of us who value friendship above all else! Ouch for those of us who rely on our friends for support and protection.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE NOBODY IS ASKING THE PRIVATE WHOLE QUESTION:
T-Rex: So who wants to come over for a drink?
T-Rex: I will bring SWEET DINOSAURS.
