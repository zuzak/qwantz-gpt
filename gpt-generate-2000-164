T-Rex: I've been working on a script! It will be a single person, one John up at the dining room table, sitting there, staring at a blank canvas. It will be something different. Something sinister. Something sinister and he - he's so handsome that when he's at the table he looks like a cross between a man and a woman.

T-Rex: It will be terrifying!

T-Rex: And then, just then, it stops and there's a new guy walking up to the table and pulling a tiny plug from his cigarette. "I'm going to punch him in the face tonight," he says, as if he's going to say anything else, and then he says, LIKE IN LITERARY TECHNOLOGY, "YOU WILL FOREVER BE ABLE TO DO THAT THING ANYMORE."

Utahraptor: T-Rex, that's so charming!
T-Rex: It doesn't?

Utahraptor: It works! It's a punchline that doesn't rely on whether or not the reader is female either. It's exciting, and the climax is exciting, and the reader(s)? They(s)?? They're readers, and they're going to punch me in the face.
T-Rex: Okay YEAH it actually involves punching people in the face but in a sexual way so fun to try too, lotses will be shown, and I'm going to sneak some contraband into the mix.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Holy crap!!
T-Rex: Utahraptor's acting like he's never punched someone in the face before!
