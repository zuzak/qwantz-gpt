T-Rex: I have the best idea for a Batman comic. It's a Batman comic about Batman.

[[second panel has no dialogue]]

T-Rex: Okay so first off off, it's a Batman comic about Batman and my super hero friends. We're named "The Dumps", and we've got a super hero thing going.
Dromiceiomimus: Um.
T-Rex: That's not what the premise is!

Utahraptor: It's a Batman comic about a dude who has a crush on a girl and - WAIT A MINUTE! - is super chummy with a pretty pretty chummy girl.
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yes. It's one of those pages where it veers wildly away from the plot, never ever actually happening.
T-Rex: It's not a bad idea, Utahraptor. I think I might be the best person to write the comic.

T-Rex: It's not my first experience with the medium though. It was developed for me by somebody else at my school, even though I was actually dating someone I know!
T-Rex: I'm developing it for them for real
