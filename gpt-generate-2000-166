T-Rex: I have been working on a script in which my actions are tracked (i.e., my reactions) using a feature I invented!

T-Rex: It's called... "Action Bars"?

T-Rex: The idea is that if an action involves some mental image being processed, a menu will appear at the top of the screen that lists all the pictures and what actions they have taken since the action was taken. The food will say "Did you also... eat that?!" and if you glance at the ingredients list you'll see a bubble with pictures of other actions.

Utahraptor: And each action bar has a corresponding menu, labelled "INSIDE THE MENU".
T-Rex: It's amazing!

T-Rex: When I eat something, my brain is training the release mechanism from their previous striated towards ACCervical, where the pictures and the words on the menu are being trained.
T-Rex: And when I eat, my brain is training the PASE OUT OF MY GIANT BODY!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: Anyway!
T-Rex: Awesome!
