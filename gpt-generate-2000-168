T-Rex: I have the best idea for a Batman comic. It's a Batman comic about a Batman who exists in our world, the real world. But he also has a frog in a cat suit!

T-Rex: SO IMPLEMENTING.

T-Rex: But the problem is, the Batman character is PRETTY RIDICULOUS. He never does anything until the last sentence. He narrates everything on the fly, and it's not even good. It's UNambitious. Every sentence is a storyteller burn, dripping with promise.
T-Rex: It's unfair!
T-Rex: I know fair, I know some people dislike it, but not FELLOWS.

Utahraptor: So lay this out! It's a story about Batman who doesn't exist, and then he burns through his cover and everyone goes dark!
T-Rex: Must be some dark secret that outdoes itself!

T-Rex: Batman saves the day by having a SUPERIOR CHARACTERS CHOICE. Robin has a lot of powers, and she's super resistant to stress. THE END.
T-Rex: *sigh*
