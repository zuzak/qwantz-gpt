T-Rex: I have come up with a perfect way to have someone else's opinions heard, without their knowing I've made some bad decisions!

T-Rex: NOT A PROBLEM!

T-Rex: I just think it's rude that we keep sending people's stupid opinions off to me knowing I've made other people's stupid decisions. It's not a problem we thought we knew about PHYSICALLY ALREADY.
Dromiceiomimus: Well, maybe we did!
T-Rex: WEIRD, DEBTS, RIGHT. We thought WE knew about that stuff.

Utahraptor: I really don't think that's a problem, T-Rex!
T-Rex: See?

Utahraptor: It's true! If you keep sending people's stupid opinions off to us knowing that I've made other people's stupid decisions, then I can start to think more of friendships more with less tension!
T-Rex: THAT, my friend, is a plan, not a theory!

God: T-REX THIS SIMPLY MAKES THINGS MORE OBVIOUS
T-Rex: God! Let's go talk more about our friendship!
God: WHATTT
God: KISSING
