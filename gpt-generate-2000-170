T-Rex: I am a man who is a part of my LIFE and who has problems with his job. I've never really found the "other person" feel to be that satisfying!

T-Rex: But I do like being with my FRIEND(S).

T-Rex: We'll date sometimes, and I really like it when it's the other person we're with. We get along really well. When it's the FRIEND of a friend, we'll get to see things together.
Dromiceiomimus: But you only get to kiss her sometimes.
T-Rex: That's true! But I'm open to working with other partners.

Utahraptor: Well, at least you have a relationship card with how things work.
T-Rex: See?

T-Rex: I'm happy to see how things pan out. I'm pretty sure that if I were a friend, I could card check things, but I can see that as a... problem?
Utahraptor: T-Rex, that is as far as I go.
T-Rex: See? YES, I will work to be as good as possible at what I do, and YES, I plan to make sure that when I'm not with my friends that I will be there...

T-Rex: ...for them.
Narrator: SOON
