T-Rex: When I was a kid, I had a singular obsession with baseball.

T-Rex: We were the kids, trying to hit a ball as hard as we could!

T-Rex: But in the later part of my teenage life, I realized that it was impossible to predict how much of a change my throwing would make. I was doomed to throw the ball at a different position every day, and every day I was sad.
T-Rex: All I could do was hope that, as a kid, I somehow - 

Utahraptor: I hope you are now too!
T-Rex: But we all hope differently!!

T-Rex: Baseball was the last thing I tried to warn you, and I know that it's part of who you are now. Baseball was the last thing I tried all the RIGHT HARD, but I still wanted to be the guy who threw the ball to the opposite team.
Utahraptor: You tried hard, but you all died.
T-Rex: Hah! Accidentally? What have you done?

T-Rex: Baseball has punished me with the ultimate career blow!
T-Rex: It has put me in a sort of rehabilitation room; in reality, it's put all the other kids in juvenile facilities.
T-Rex: If I keep throwing the ball to the opposite team, I could die there!
