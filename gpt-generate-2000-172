T-Rex: I know it's terrible, and I know many people are like this. But I can't deny it any longer! I am that guy!

T-Rex: But it's also entirely fair, because few people deny that being gay is a choice! Many people who are gay are just doing their best, and when they do they're doing it because they want to. They're not trying to DIE; they're just not happy with the results.

T-Rex: It's so universal: being poly is a wonderful thing to do, but being straight is a great thing to do, but being bi is a great thing to be happy with. Some people are poly, some aren't, and we don't know for sure.

Utahraptor: I really don't!
T-Rex: But it's so universal! It's unfair, because different people choose to be poly and some choose to be straight and some choose to be both.

T-Rex: I can't help but feel the same way!
