T-Rex: Have you ever wanted to learn about computers?

T-Rex: Hah hah, no.

T-Rex: I was thinking the other day, and it haunted me as if they WERE TOTALLY MURDERING CHIPS. Come to think of it, I now realize, I should be able to use my computer to learn about computers. Ah, the curse!

Utahraptor: And then, you had to pay?
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: Besides, if I learned about zombies then maybe some of them would be interested in me, would I not? It is the same with the computer and its parts. I'll admit it, I have been bitten by a computer zombie...
Utahraptor: ...but that is a skill to be cultivated, as is the case with most vices.

T-Rex: Utahraptor, come quick! I am going to take you all to the computer.
T-Rex: Ha ha! What? No, we'll go in for lunch.
T-Rex: All I want to do is talk to the staff and get to know them better.
