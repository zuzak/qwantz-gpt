T-Rex: Today is the day I write a story for the next decade. A little complicating, I know, because I'm actually building a family business!

Narrator: I ACCIDENTALLY Write a Book About Myself!

T-Rex: So! How does it go?
Narrator: YEARS LATER:
T-Rex: I'm still the same T-Rex I always am!
Dromiceiomimus: But that's only until you say... two hundred and fifty dollars?
T-Rex: Hah! Two hundred and fifty dollars, please!

Narrator: TWENTY TRILLION YEARS LATER:
Utahraptor: Twenty-five dollars?
T-Rex: Hah! PERFECT.

Narrator: TWIN TOIES AND A FEW DOLLARS LATER:
T-Rex (thinking): Hey, how do you get fifty dollars today?
Utahraptor (thinking): It's a sucky way to get the last word!
T-Rex (thinking): I'll tell you how I used to get a sucky way to get the last word.
Utahraptor (thinking): And I'll show you how I invented the double-check sign!
