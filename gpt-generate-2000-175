T-Rex: Oh my Gosh that was T-Rex, the guy who put together the best cereal. His name was "Science And Religion".

T-Rex: And on his back was a card that read "PROTECTION AND THEISTOS".

T-Rex: Clearly a message telling us to "enjoy a good laugh" and "check out religions that have explained clearly what you want to avoid doing if you're serious"!
Dromiceiomimus: Sounds like an awesome job!
T-Rex: I'M SO EXCITED. I SERIOUSLY WOULD LEAP TO EAT THE COMIC.

Utahraptor: Hey, can we at least get together and hang out something?
T-Rex: Sure.

T-Rex: But I can't make an appointment unless I have some sort of notice that says "OKAY, Okay, This Town Finally Has Been Able to Play Nice At Giving Up Our Greedy Use For Men". So yeah, I'm totally going to try.
Utahraptor: Okay.

Narrator: THE NEXT DAY, T-REX'S HOUSE IS SWARMED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ALLEGEMENT ARRIVES:
Off-panel voice: Hello T-Rex, why don't you at least take some of my cereal for a walk?
T-Rex: NICE QUESTION!
