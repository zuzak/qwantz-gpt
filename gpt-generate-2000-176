T-Rex: Is this the future? The beginning? The beginning of things that move, the power of language to change and refine our ideas and opinions, and the beauty and folly of war?

T-Rex: Not necessarily!!

T-Rex: When we talk about the future we're not babbling in it, rather, we're talking about GOOD NINE TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BALLS.
Dromiceiomimus: "Future selves" is the most interesting part of this comic! You could read my mind-body exchange and make it sound okay, and there's no reason it couldn't be okay.
T-Rex: But "goods" is the wrong word to use here!

Utahraptor: I find it interesting you're using the future self as a guide, as it's the only book that's all "good stuff".
T-Rex: It's a VIABLE PHRASE, and future selves are used as guides here.

T-Rex: Future selves SPEAK OF before this comic went out, and that's the only future self we know. They were all young guys experimenting with different things, and all the future selfs were experimenting with... MAGIC.
Utahraptor: So - yes?
T-Rex: YES, YES. YES, YES.

T-Rex: And YES, YES and YES and all I'll say is that YES.
T-Rex: I'm really enjoying this comic now.
