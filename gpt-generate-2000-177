T-Rex: When I have a problem, I always try to come up with solutions!  Sometimes I'll use a refactoring technique called "reinventing the wheel" to facilite the problem, but there's no such thing as a new approach!  There's only a series of twists and turns, and I'll remind everyone that my problems are problems that need solving.

T-Rex: I call this "Explosion 1: Making wheel spins go faster"!

Utahraptor: Why?

T-Rex: Because it's the solution to the SUCCESS of the problem!  We all should get on this.

T-Rex: I need you to come up with a solution that won't go wrong forever!
T-Rex: Hey!
