T-Rex: You know what? I totally figured out what I want out of life. I totally figured out what I want out of life. Okay, so the guy who comes to my door and says "I don't want to talk to you, but may God be with us: we'll be out of here soon" is kind of a jerk, right?

T-Rex: But it wasn't that bad!

T-Rex: I got kinda antsy.  I don't know! I THINK I will eventually settle for "pretty much always walking in the door" or at the very least, "a closeup inspection of my house may show the door is not just a mite but one of a very large and extremely dangerous species." 
Dromiceiomimus: But wouldn't it be nice to be alone for a few hours while we talk about this?
T-Rex: It would be nice.  I like it, and yet I am beginning to think that this could be a very bad idea!

Utahraptor: You think it could be nice?
T-Rex: It would be nice, baby!

T-Rex: I like the feeling of walking into a place, alone, and with no one to talk to. It is a feeling that can only be described as "terrible". 
Utahraptor: That's not what you said!
T-Rex: That's not what I said! I always say, "I'm not afraid to talk to someone; it is what it is, is quite frankly, the best thing I have ever felt."

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND:
T-Rex: Hey Shakespeare! Monologues don't invite guests!
Shakespeare: T-REX, don't you think it would be pretty nice to have conversations about religion with me?
T-Rex: Perhaps!
