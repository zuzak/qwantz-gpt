T-Rex: I am a guy who likes to keep pretty much all of my pretension to myself to my own devices and to myself.

T-Rex: Pretty sure I'm a guy who only pretends to know what I'm talking about!

T-Rex: Okay, so let's say I'm the one with the cooler theories. We're all familiar with her, right? We all know she's a crazy person who totally just happened to be living in comic relief when she said she was going to murder some more.

T-Rex: Finally, she's got no detectable mental disorder!

T-Rex: And the rest of us can agree that this woman has a pretty great time, by the way!

T-Rex: Alright, so we agree that this woman has a pretty great time, by the way!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE SHE REALIZES HER SPECIALTY WAS KILLING MORE PEOPLE THAN THAT OFC:
T-Rex: AHHHHHHHHHH
