T-Rex: I have a friend who I'll call "Jennifer" if he gets her any kind of food. I'll catch him eating... anything.

T-Rex: Food!

Dromiceiomimus: Wait, "Jennifer"?
T-Rex: A food? Seriously! "Jennifer"?
Dromiceiomimus: "Jennifer"?
T-Rex: I'm having dinner with a food group of like-minded people!

Utahraptor: So what happens?
T-Rex: They all decide to remain anonymous!

T-Rex: So no bigs, just zero in on that food and say "I'll pick a fight with food groupings like Jennifer"?
Utahraptor: Then they go their separate ways.
T-Rex: Then they leave, saying "We'll see about that."

Utahraptor: And then they come back again, saying "We'll see about that."
T-Rex: Then they go their separate ways again!
T-Rex: THEN they talk about feelings!
