T-Rex: You know those guys who get their friends killed by a giant with a chainsaw? It doesn't happen often, but I do want to take this opportunity to say a word about it.

T-Rex: "Not really"!

T-Rex: Anyway, the big news is that the chainsaw was invented centuries ago by a dude who just so happened to be a woman.  He literally invented it when he was a kid.  The ancient Greeks were better than me at knowing a word like "reactionary" than "thoughtcrasher", but they didn't invent the word "thoughtcrasher" because they were too busy developing the REST OF THE BRAND".
Dromiceiomimus: I think the word is sometimes confused with "thoughtcrude", though.
T-Rex: Sometimes the word is confused with "thoughtcrude", though.

Utahraptor: Or "cannibalistic", personified?
T-Rex: In the dictionary!

T-Rex: It's just -- cannibally, anyway.  That's how we'reall structured.  Basically, the cannibals are inside your cereal, and when you open it, they're wrapping around your arm.  In their eyes.  In your hand.  In your hand up your arm.  When you remove the cannibals they're already wrapping around your arm, and it's moving through your hand.  They keep going back up your hand until you're arm yourself.

T-Rex: It's been done before me in passing, though.
