T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus is going on vacation! Trivially paid SEVERAL thousand dollars in exchange for no more than a few scrapbook articles of clothing?

T-Rex: I don't know!

T-Rex: I do know, though, that she's going to demand that I wear these clothes all the time. That's totally her fault, and I don't blame her.  I just wonder what she's up to these days.
Dromiceiomimus: I blame society!
T-Rex: I blame society AND my own actions for getting me so worked up that I take off the top of my head right now.

Utahraptor: I'm not saying that's bad!
T-Rex: Again, absolutely not!

T-Rex: I just think that it raises a ton of questions.  These are the questions that demand more research into my own well-being in the modern world!  Perhaps - some of these questions are still being asked today - but I am experimenting with the sounds of my own voice.
Utahraptor: You know what? I do not!

T-Rex: Experiment with the sounds of your own voice!
