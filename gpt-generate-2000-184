Narrator: COMPRESSED CLASSIC SCIENCE FICTION SHORT STORIES
Narrator: in this issue...

T-Rex: Sherlock Holmes, huh?

T-Rex: I guess I just like the idea of a "shallow Grave" where you can bury the bad stuff without burying the good stuff.  But, you know, "good stuff"!  It's like burying a large volume of wet paper in an emergency room, but with a spooky little cat prank.
Dromiceiomimus: I like the idea of burying wet things in a spooky manner, too!  The added shock will scare the inspector off, but also make him or her afraid.
T-Rex: That's why I like the ghostly magic.

Utahraptor: When you design a spooky book or other creepy-galactic book, you want the ghost to be cautious with you (asking if you'd be interested in ghostbusting him)!
T-Rex: Here he comes!

T-Rex: If you don't let him know, he might go "no, I don't want to be a ghost."  Or maybe tell him he's not a human, or perhaps even a ghost.  Or perhaps fleshy mutt.  Whatever.  Just let him deal with that.  Can't we all just agree that while we can't all be on the same page, it's actually better than disinterested onlookers?

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYONE IS A SPIDER-MAN CORPSE:
T-Rex: Man, I totally like Spider-Man.
