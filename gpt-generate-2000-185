T-Rex: It sure is easy to fall in love!

T-Rex: It sure is easy to fall in love sometimes, you guys!

T-Rex: But it's also so easy to forget that I don't have the strength to fall in love.  I don't have the strength to fall in love all the time.  I don't have the strength to fall in love all the time either.
Dromiceiomimus: You don't have the strength to fall in love either, T-Rex.
T-Rex: I'm pretty sure I do!

Utahraptor: So why do you think people fall in love?
T-Rex: It can be pretty frustrating, doesn't it?

T-Rex: It can be pretty frustrating, huh? It can be that one feels like he's failed or that he's probably the only one, at this level, who truly is in love.
Utahraptor: I think that it can also be pretty frustrating when people aren't having sex with each other all the time.

T-Rex: That's what I'm saying!
