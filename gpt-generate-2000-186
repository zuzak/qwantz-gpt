T-Rex: At some point or another, we'd all go on a date and have an up-to-date look at our dating interests.  We'd set up shrimps, and hook up with the most recent "Go Fish It" surveys and that weird "Hey You Guys! I Want To Visit A Site I Don't Want People From Other Profiles Talking About This Site With Me".  And then we'd clean up the website of all references to "sexy guys" and "romance babes" - we used "sexy guys" for a reason!

T-Rex: We'd then have sex, and that's sex for all of us!

T-Rex: I'm really enjoying this story. It's full of romantic comedy, but not necessarily the full range of "sex".  But I'm sure we can work that in tonight's episode of "The Early Show with special thanks to our late David Morris," at 11:00 p.m.
T-Rex: David Morris!  You're on "The Early Show with special thanks to all our late and excellent T-Tim Spalding cast."

Utahraptor: You're late for a date?
Morris: I'm late for a date!
T-Rex: Um - I have a good one for you.
Utahraptor: Hi, David Morris.  How are you?
Morris: Oh, fine! GREAT. Listen, I have a very personal story, and as such I am asking that you do the same.

T-Rex: Yes please.  This is Morris' "The Early Show with special thanks to all my good and good friends."
