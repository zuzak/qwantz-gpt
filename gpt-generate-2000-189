T-Rex:  It's hard to say what the future holds.  There's so much guesswork!

T-Rex:  But dudes!  

T-Rex:  I have the best idea.  It's a robot suit!
Dromiceiomimus:  It's a robot?
T-Rex:  It's a robot suit until Dromiceiomimus comes along and I use robot suits to rebuild the Future!
T-Rex:  But WHICH robot?  I don't know.  

Utahraptor:  It could be the future's ULTIMATE CHAMPION or robot lifespans, my friend!
T-Rex:  That seems like a pretty serious prediction.

Utahraptor:  It's still the future's only robot if you don't mess it up.  You could save a princess and then have her fly away, only the future animatronic prince will still be able to hover in the hovercar.  The hovercar won't go more than a few kilometers per hour.
T-Rex:  WHAT?!
T-Rex:  I'm getting HUNGRY.

Narrator:  BACK AT HOME:
T-Rex:  Huh, he's the only one that I can believe in real life.
T-Rex:  He rules while I'm away, YOU DAD.
