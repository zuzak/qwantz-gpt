T-Rex: Hey, is it 5 AM? Maybe it's 10 AM? Maybe it's 1 PM? Maybe it's 10 PM P.M.?

T-Rex: Pardon me? MAYBE it is 10 AM, but it's not 11 AM because the internet froze for a while.
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, maybe it's noon because you had breakfast before lunch?
T-Rex: Man, people say that.

Narrator: THE END

Narrator: NOTE TO FRIENDS:
Utahraptor: T-Rex, you've become a pervert's worst enemy!
T-Rex: Am I right?

T-Rex: I never really understood friendship as a journey. It's a thing you do, but each time you leave a message, it's really the same message: how did this relationship go? And it's not just emotional: there's the physical thing as well, where if you don't return within two hours, you might as well be gone for good!

Utahraptor: What's friendship like without the person?
T-Rex: It's so weird!

T-Rex: We're all like, "Hello, my name is T-Rex and I am a handsome guy and we're friends with my girlfriend," and then there's a sexual thing too. It's weird. We're like, "Here is our last communication," and then, we eat an awful lot of spaghetti.

T-Rex: I don't want to do this.
Narrator: WHY ARE PEOPLE GOING SO SLOWLY ABOUT THEIR FRIENDS
Narrator: THEY ARE ALREADY GONE?
