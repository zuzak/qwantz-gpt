T-Rex:  Hello, friend!  I have some questions for you.

T-Rex:  For my answer to question one, I think it would be best if everyone said "I'm sick and alone" instead of "Oh man, that's racist!"

T-Rex:  Okay Dromiceiomimus, let's discuss it!  How do you feel about a lot of things?
Dromiceiomimus:  Well, I'm happy to see you, T-Rex!  I like your skin tone.
T-Rex:  Oh my god!  I know it!!  It makes me feel like a new normal is under construction.

Utahraptor:  Do you want to go shopping with me?
T-Rex:  I -

Utahraptor:  No!  Okay, this is fine.  I am going to have a good salad.
T-Rex:  Of course!

T-Rex:  I will simply toss a salad under the table and those around me will fall to the universal deciduous evil.
Utahraptor:  Then I'll throw you back under the bus!
T-Rex:  Good luck!
