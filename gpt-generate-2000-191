Narrator: GENDER RIGHTS
T-Rex: You can now choose your own path!

T-Rex: Personally, I'm looking for a... A JERKY WAY of looking at things.  An active lifestyle that avoids the guilt that comes with living a dead and lonely life.

T-Rex: I can't decide if I want to go off and do other things without actually going off and doing other things, or if I'll just go off and find a good book I can read.
T-Rex: Or both, I'm not certain.
T-Rex: Or both, is either of these options TOILET?

Utahraptor: Your choice of narrative path seems at odds with the premise, at least for those who like their characters to go off and do other things.

T-Rex: Perhaps the first option seems more at odds with the rest of the options, until Utahraptor points out that the rest of the options have no effect!  They all go on!  There is no effect!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, that's a brilliant premise!  All you've done is added an alternate narrative path that leads you to a book you can't read.
