T-Rex: When I die, I want to be buried in a bog.  But the last time I die, someone dug up my body and stuck me there!

T-Rex: That's not who I am anymore!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, would you please start a conversation, Dromiceiomimus?
Dromiceiomimus: Sure! Would it not be best not to do both at the same time?
T-Rex: That's right! I will start by becoming aware of what words are considered "strong" and what words are considered "unaware", as per the "Sleepy Hollow Scenarios"!

T-Rex: Then I will proceed to become aware of what words are considered "unaware" and "unaware", as per the "T-Rex Schemes" scenario!
Utahraptor: Sounds good!

Utahraptor: And then I will proceed to become aware of the properties of each of the "Unaware" words, as per the "Sleepy Hollow Schemes" scenario!
T-Rex: So expand on those, and you are good! You are good!
Utahraptor: Good!

Narrator: SOON, EVERYONE IS GOOD AGAIN
T-Rex: Good!
