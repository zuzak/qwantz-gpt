T-Rex: I just realized that I, as the dude who invented the toast that has "Sloppy", am no better than a veritable treasure hunt throughout time.

T-Rex: Now I'm poing on people who are SO STACKED their ideas of truth and falsity are beyond me now!

T-Rex: Not gonna lie: I'm not a flip phone guy, but I am someone else's li'l T-Rex!
T-Rex: So true!!

Utahraptor: Hey, can I borrow a minute?
T-Rex: Sure can!

T-Rex: I mean, I'll come to you, my friend, and tell you how I've come to invent toast!
Utahraptor: Excellent! Excellent.
T-Rex: Then I'll be able to trust my gut feeling!

Narrator: THE END
