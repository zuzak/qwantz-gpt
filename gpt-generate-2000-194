Narrator: T-REX IN: "WRAPPING PRESENTS IN YOUR BODY"
T-Rex: I'm going to stop and think about what I'm going to do with my life.

T-Rex: I'm going to stop and think about what I've bought and what clothes and what software I've got to get myself used to!

T-Rex: I'm going to stop and think about what I've read and learned and what computers people and machines are!
T-Rex: And I'm going to stop and think about what people who MIGHTN'T THINK WE'RE friends REALLY ARE.

Utahraptor: It's a terrific idea, T-Rex! Stop believing you're a friend because you put so much meaning and possibility into every possible situation.

T-Rex: What? I am! I am even!!

T-Rex: Isn't the whole point? At the end, I'll just stop being me, I'm going to stop being T-Rex.
Utahraptor: Stop!

Utahraptor: That's not very supportive!
T-Rex: I'm going to continue to be T-Rex!
T-Rex: Eh?
