T-Rex: I am a dude with some friggin' FLOOD SOURCES. So I am going to go do some damage control stuff.

T-Rex: Alright, so I've got some dried infection wounds where I could probably get some bacteria running in there.

T-Rex: And next up I'm going to get some dried infection wounds where I could probably get some dirt running in there.
T-Rex: And next up I'm going to get some dried dirt that's gonna last for thousands of years.

Utahraptor: You're going to dry everything out?
T-Rex: Next?

T-Rex: Next up is I'm going to get some dried dirt that's gonna last for thousands of years and that if dried, can dry grease-rich for thousands of years after the fossilized remains of complex life, once we leave the planet.
Utahraptor: That's a great dinosaur you got, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Thanks!

Utahraptor: That's a great dinosaur you got, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Thanks for that, dear friend.
