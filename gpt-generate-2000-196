T-Rex: Alex and Amelia had just had an ANCIENT SEX.  They were going to have intercourse, but it was all a dream!  Alex was going to have sex with Amelia, and then she'd have sex with herself.

T-Rex: It was a sex dream, right?

T-Rex: Anyway!  Alex and Amelia had sex, and then Alex said "I am going to have intercourse with Amelia next".  This was a sex dream, right?  This was a dream.

T-Rex: Um.  Um.  *I* don't*
T-Rex: ...Don't answer that
