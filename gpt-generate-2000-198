T-Rex: My stars, am I ever enamoured with robots. Man! Like them. They're great. They're role playing. They're great. Like MARIO ROBIN. They're great in some way, shape, or form.

T-Rex: They're great because they make me want to run down the stairs and punch MARIO ROBIN in the face!

T-Rex: Okay, so robots are great. Great. Say what? Why don't they just do the same job for us humans too?
Dromiceiomimus: Sure. Are we, as a people, up to something?
T-Rex: Perhaps!

T-Rex: Perhaps the robots we create will one day be people we ABSOLUTELY emulate. For instance, in some robots I may be dim and stoic, while in others I could dim and be cruel to others, for even in most I could still be disturbing.

Utahraptor: So there will be robots who, when in need, will be a robot willing to lend a hand!
T-Rex: Oh absolutely.

T-Rex: And this leads us nicely into our next issue! In it, we look ahead and see how far we've come in just the past 24 hours, and you'd think that the robots we've put in charge of creating them would be more into the cause than the effect. But it's not that simple.
Utahraptor: You want the robots to play by their own rules.
T-Rex: I do!

T-Rex: I'm running experiments in my basement to see what effects we'd have on the rest of the universe.
T-Rex: Couldn't make a gross out!
