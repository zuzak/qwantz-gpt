T-Rex: I was informed today that the Utahraptor has a pet dog!

T-Rex: Oh snap!

T-Rex: You are going to love him! He'll be your new best friend.
T-Rex: And he won't mind if you poop on his tail, okay??
T-Rex: His name's... T-Rex.

Utahraptor: Wait- how did I forget about that dog part?
T-Rex: Guess what, me too!

T-Rex: Guess what, Utahraptor? I named him "The Terrier I Know"!
Utahraptor: He's right beneath your nose.
T-Rex: He's right beneath the brow of MY lungs.

T-Rex: He's right beneath the perineum upon which all of modern civilization relies.
T-Rex: HE'S the greatest.
T-Rex: HE'S the greatest ever.
