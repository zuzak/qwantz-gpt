T-Rex: We've got some problems with communication! We've got some problems with communication with respect!

T-Rex: To begin, let's assume we're friends when a woman wants a man of her own gender. We follow a shared interest in gender roles!
Dromiceiomimus: That doesn't seem that likely, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Well, I guess I'm not going to run the risk of alienating someone who REALLY wants gender-neutral pronouns.

Utahraptor: That's actually not a problem!
T-Rex: You're right!

T-Rex: Instead of saying "You want torothenueguy", say "You know what'd be great? Let's discuss such issues as no married couple gets married in this land."
Utahraptor: That sounds like "let's discuss the issues of marriage equality."
T-Rex: Okay!
