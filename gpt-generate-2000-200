T-Rex: It's not always that great

T-Rex: I can hear it yammering in my head through to the end: "T-Rex, let's not get caught... let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's"?
T-Rex: I'd rather have a good time without feeling like I'm watching a pretty okay program

Utahraptor: But - let's hear it for us, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's not always that great

T-Rex: Sometimes when I'm in a relationship the only communication is through words! Is that okay? Let's hear it for you, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: Of course!
