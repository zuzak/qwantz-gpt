T-Rex: So get ready, my friends will be SURPRISED!!

T-Rex:  First, there'll be the dinosaur called Mr. Tusks, who can run for president but can't get a single vote from votersGGH! And second, there'll be the gargantuan green T-Rex, and third, there'll be the one with the stupidest name.
T-Rex: WAIT A SECOND -- T-REX'S NAME -- is WAY better than his opposite number's!

Dromiceiomimus: Aw, I think I might have been a little confusing this year! Do you have other unresolved businesss?
T-Rex: I have other businesss that are still being worked out.
Dromiceiomimus: Another year and another TINY bit of open question has to wait!
