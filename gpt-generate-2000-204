T-Rex: So! I've been writing a romance novel!

T-Rex: It's called "The World Our Parents Born Weigh In On Us To Make Us Want To See More Of The Same Kinds Of Things We Imagined We'd Be Doing Now".

T-Rex: I'm super excited about it! It's about a woman who -
T-Rex: She can do all sorts of things.
T-Rex: She can lead, she can be... pretty much.
T-Rex: ...She can... be... pretty much.

Utahraptor: What are you doing, developing a plot device for a book, developing a narrative device with a narrative device?
T-Rex: What?

Utahraptor: It's not a book, dude! It's a REAL book!
T-Rex: But SERIOUSLY?
Utahraptor: It's a REAL book.
T-Rex: So my characters are like, "Hey, here's how I make my stories better."
Utahraptor: "Weighing in with Language to Compound Romance with Astute Listenability Measures".

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Is it terrible? Because, I can write a better diary!  I write "Oh no oh no" and then I say "Okay thanks let's break up now."
T-Rex: And I rephrase the sentence to "It's a five point five scale, I wonder if I'm breaking up with someone"!
T-Rex: And I rephrase the sentence to "And yet, I keep on breaking up with that person"
