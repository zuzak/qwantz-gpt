T-Rex: Oh my god, is it Christmas?!

T-Rex: I love it!

T-Rex: I can't unsee it, Dromiceiomimus, it's like a TV show Christmas special - you watch it on the big holiday show, and there's a kid - skateboarding down some quiet country roads, and there's a guy walking by, and he's making out with some house-nepotism. It's such a TV special! And the kid pulls away, and then the TV freezes, so it's on its own, but in a silly spinoff, so cute, that nobody cares that it's embarrassing. It's a good television comedy!
Dromiceiomimus: I don't know what to make of Christmas?
T-Rex: It's such a nice TV movie!

Utahraptor: I think there's a lot to it, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I think it's so charming!

T-Rex: I think there's a fair bit of magic there, too! I think it's such a brilliant, moving portrait of Christmas!
Utahraptor: Me too!

T-Rex: Man, I like it! It says in the title: "I KNOW YOU LOVE A CHICKEN PARLOUR ("BERLIN")".
T-Rex: It's such a good book!
