T-Rex: Oh my gosh, I have to start running. Oh my gosh.

T-Rex: Run at all times!

T-Rex: Run at all times! DO IT AT NIGHT. Do it whenever you have time! DO IT AT DAY. Do it whenever a storm is raging or something. Not sure what all these talk of "elite track records" are, but sure, I'm going to try!
Dromiceiomimus: Run whenever possible when possible!
T-Rex: Oh, Dromiceiomimus?

Utahraptor: Run whenever possible when possible!
T-Rex: IT'S CALLED THE "MEANING EPITaph".

T-Rex: It's basically "asking for stuff". From now on, whenever possible, you'll stop being myself.
Utahraptor: That's a pretty okay name!
T-Rex: It's the epitaph for being unable to have "any meaningful conversation about anything".
Utahraptor: Well, I suppose you could use it in reference to the First Law of being incorporeal?

Narrator: MEANING EPITaph: It was inspired by the phrase "phrase from before the computer age", which was then followed by the expression "from a ridiculous age when we really needed a name that also didn't mention us."
T-Rex: Um, NOT AGAIN
