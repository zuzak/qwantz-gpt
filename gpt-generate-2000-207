T-Rex: I am a man who, despite appearances, still kinda has MANLY MANLY. In fact, I'm even manlier than before when I was conceived.

T-Rex: Pretty crazy!

T-Rex: In fact, pretty crazy, I would conservatively call the case for manliness some day. But it turns out I have just one more thing to do!
T-Rex: Is set to "set to a routine of boring but related issues".

Utahraptor: Is fixing the problem to be more popular?
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: And I'll continue to do that until there's not really a choice to fixing problems, you know? And that's two years after problems set, so I'd expect that some day there'll be some problems with my set to "set to a routine of boring but related issues".
Utahraptor: Two years after you break up with someone?
T-Rex: Two years!

Narrator: T-REX'S MANLY MAN:
T-Rex: I was with him the whole time!
T-Rex: Year after year!
