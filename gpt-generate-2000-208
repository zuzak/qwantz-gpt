T-Rex:  I think I have cancer. I think I have a blood cancer. And I don't want to talk about it!

T-Rex:  I don't want to talk about it either!!

T-Rex:  I don't want to talk about it either!!  I've tried to make it seem as if my first few months as a teen were some sort of therapy to make me -
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, you've got a rash too.
T-Rex: IT'S CALLED THE "SARANYAHOW".
T-Rex: IT'S MAKEOUTS.

Utahraptor:  But what about the multiday breast cancer trial you're going to do?
T-Rex:  I'm going to start it on Christmas Day!

T-Rex:  I'm going to go on a trip to the hospital and we're going to make sure that cancer patients know that cancer is treatable, so they'll go out into the world for Christmas!
Utahraptor:  ...I, um, plan on waiting until the trial rolls around before talking about cancer.

Narrator:  LATER, T-REX EXPLAINS HIS BIBLE, WHICH HE LIKES!
T-Rex:  Wow!  And the first sentence is actually kind of amazing, because it's not actually true!  That sentence is more like "Hey, digression was ruled by chance, and even so, no christmas present has gone out to any dead man."
T-Rex:  I'm PRETTY SURE it is.
