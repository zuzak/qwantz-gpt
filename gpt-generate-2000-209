T-Rex: I have a great idea for a movie!  Oh goodness.  This movie.  I have all the elements necessary to establish the all-star cast of cartoons and then have them make their way to the big screen.  It's not as fun as cartoons, but it's closer than I thought.  My ultimate movie is called "Mr. Daroon!"

T-Rex: It stars James T. Aparicio and Andrew Garfield!

T-Rex: So the premise is, "Now this is what cartoons look like: guys putting on cartoonishly hilarious cartoons," and they're really only doing their best when they make mistakes.  But in the sequel, they're not putting on so many cartoonishly hilarious cartoons: regular cartoon, fantastical cartoon.  It's this eclectic mix that gives 'em their distinctive accent.
Dromiceiomimus: It seems to me the best medium for a movie is probably some genre-neutral, non-harmful medium.
T-Rex: I don't see why not.

Utahraptor: I don't see why not!  The medium is JUST one of many used in heavy genres: "cartoonistomy", "fantastical cartoonism", and, ARGUABLY, "mirror images of famous people doing their best".
T-Rex: Mirrored images, my friend!  THE UNIVERSE ITSELF is teeming with mirror images, its own little ooze of greatness!

Utahraptor: I'm not convinced such films are truly mirror images, T-Rex!  Especially not lately, with all the focus on T-Rex and His Delusions and the focus on T-Rex's Amazing Grace.  Even with all the focus on Garfield and the Multiverse and everything else, I still have the single most important issue: who is mirror doing their best?
T-Rex: Garfield!  Mine is... Pussy?

Person: You must not have been doing anything amazing, baby
