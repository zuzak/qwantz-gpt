T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate bad guy! He's like the guy who walks around naked, with a giant hole in his crotch and a blood red eyes and a sign saying "I WANT A TATTOO" tattooed on his loincloth.

T-Rex: It's just terrible!

T-Rex: This guy has no ID and when he shows up the people he's attacked won't be the same people he was before. He'll be criminals, trying to win back the person he was before. And now, the Devil!
Devil: GREETINGS T-REX I HAVE BECOME THE PROGRAMMING MACHINE FOR HITLER
T-Rex: I have become your confidant?
Devil: WELL THEN I THINK

Utahraptor: Let's see what's happened! From now on, you're always looking for ways to undermine me!
T-Rex: I'm not!

T-Rex: I'm just the icing on the cake! I'm the one who has authority!
Devil: I SEE THE ALTERNATE PLAN
T-Rex: Then we'll call that awesome!
Utahraptor: Then what!
T-Rex: Utahraptor, we're going to call "The Wedding Who Made The World Laugh In His Best F-F-F-F-F-F-Sorts"!

T-Rex: And he has a bride and he dresses. He loves his wedding so much that he decides to do something about it!
Devil: THE END
