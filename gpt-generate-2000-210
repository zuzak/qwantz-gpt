T-Rex: The first law of thermodynamics:

T-Rex: Important!

T-Rex: The second law of thermodynamics: somewhat less important.
T-Rex: If the laws were personified, I'd feel more at ease.  I'd be more of a "cool kid" and therefore more at ease.  And I would feel more at ease.  And I'd feel more at ease.  And I'd feel more at ease.  And I'd feel more at ease.  And I'd feel more at ease.  And if any of this sounds familiar, well - then you too may have felt worse about your previous friggin' winters, huh?

Utahraptor: Act fast and you die!
T-Rex: Oh, I feel better already!!

Utahraptor: Dude, you feel worse about your previous friggin' winters, huh?
T-Rex: Act quickly and you die!  Everyone says you should act fast and act like a man, but act like a dinosaur too?
Utahraptor: Everyone says act fast, but act slow, act defeatore!

T-Rex: THAT'S IT!
