T-Rex: FACT: there's a lot of disease happening at the same time and it makes sense that they'd be happening at the same time!

T-Rex: It's FACT that we need more time to think, correct our flaws, and build a better future!

T-Rex: Therefore: more time! Faster computers, computers which compress data faster, and so on.
Dromiceiomimus: But wouldn't it take more time to build a computer which can move matter faster (i.e.: self-repairing armour)?
T-Rex: Couldn't more time be faster (i.e.: self-repairing blood) faster (i.e.: faster, more powerful computers) to build a better, more perfect future?

Utahraptor: I suppose if we're trying to build a better, more perfect future THEN we'd want faster (i.e.: more powerful) computers.
T-Rex: But computers can take much longer to build than computers can be.

Utahraptor: I suppose if we're going to build faster (i.e.: more powerful) computers then I'm not being entirely honest.
T-Rex: Really?

T-Rex: You're just saying that because computers can take much longer to build than other computers. It's probably a talking point, or at least an implication, that we can't.
T-Rex: Anyway! I'm not going to lie: I'm totally impressed.
