Narrator: THINGS THAT WILL MAKE YOU SOUNDIER THAN YOU ARE
T-Rex: Oh boy!

T-Rex: I am a great friend, and I will make ANY story fail!

T-Rex: I have never read the dictionary and would probably still love another story!
Dromiceiomimus: But you've read the dictionary, and you will make ANY story fail, so your story sucks.
T-Rex: True! But dictionaries exist to ensure good dictionaries. If I change the subject from "eating disorders" to "ANTISOMIC SEXUAL ASST. DISEASES", then so too will my tale fail!

Utahraptor: But you've said many things in your tale, so give it a read!
T-Rex: It is friggin' good!

T-Rex: "Antisomically spicy"? Dromiceiomimus said that, and you said many things in your tale, so give it a read!
Utahraptor: Sure!
T-Rex: I will!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex (from off-panel): It's definitely tasty, T-Rex!
T-Rex (from off-panel): Really?
T-Rex (from off-panel): As I say, I think so!
