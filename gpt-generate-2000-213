T-Rex:  The problem with Superman, and Batman, and pretty much every superhero, is that they're all super human.  They're not afraid to ask for help.

T-Rex:  But that's not always true.

T-Rex:  Sometimes when they try to, they'll run away!  And that's sad, because sometimes they'll try to help ME, and in that try I feel like I have to offer help, and I feel like I'll be helped even MORE than before, and only then will I be as full as I was before.  It's unfair, and I'm REALLY looking for sympathy.

Utahraptor:  Someone will eventually want to help Clark find balance in his relationships!
T-Rex:  Someone?

Utahraptor:  Well, I think eventually people will want to help each other figure out their issues!  Eventually they'll want to work on their shared identity.  Then we can expect a solution.
T-Rex:  Then I guess I'm really looking for sympathy, and I'm gonna go do it.
