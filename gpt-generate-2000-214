T-Rex: I'm not as gullible as people seem to think I am. I mean, I know the Utahraptor is here, but he's not here to sate my "needs".

T-Rex: He's here to fulfill some vaguely-defined "needset".

T-Rex: He's here to "plug the hell up" or "plug the internet back in a few minutes".
Dromiceiomimus: Okay. He's here to fulfill some vaguely-defined "needslick suck".
T-Rex: He's here to fulfill some vaguely-defined "needslick suck", of which there are some :-).

Utahraptor: These are the "ischemibilit".
T-Rex: ...

T-Rex: Uh... "ischemibilitimikuberries"?
Utahraptor: Congrats, you've got a Twitter bio to fill!
T-Rex: See? See?
T-Rex: It's not hard to do!

T-Rex: So, what's the first SOUNDRESS YOU'VE EVERTTED?
Utahraptor: "Short" means "stuck", and "hard" means "extremely hard"
T-Rex: Congratulations, you've got a Twitter bio here!
Utahraptor: See, it's not hard, once you figure out how to use it.

T-Rex: Congratulations, you've got a Google image search for "I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really REALLY really really really REALLY really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really

T-Rex: And then, one by one, the women from these sewing houses reveal themselves, reveal they're totally chaste, confessing their sordid history to their friends, and begin transforming themselves from mere mortals into chaste, wealthy patrons!
Utahraptor: And then!

T-Rex: And then, a throng of naked women gather and begin stripping, presumably of chaste sexual organs, apparently WITHOUT CONSENT.  Wow! This is imagination free literature, my friend!!
Utahraptor: And then, a sexy Paul Grice and a bunch of other grrrls show up and tell the audience that they've found something that is AMAZING, and then, they get to read it?

T-Rex: AWESOME, in a CHRAZY T-REX universe!
T-Rex: Okay!
