T-Rex: I'm not a guy who is afraid to say stupid things.  But I am a guy who is afraid of stupid things!

T-Rex: Um - things like - being afraid of helicopter blades?

T-Rex: Or, fearing the words "pooty" and "pooty" for short.  Or - OR I COULD COME UP WITH AN INTONE-FREE UNIVERSE IN ORDER, THAT IS.
Dromiceiomimus: I think you're afraid of "the unreasonable" stuff, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I am not!  It's like - I'm afraid of "the albatross between the shoulders", or the doubt that interrupts my thought process as I consider the implications!

T-Rex: Or like when Miranda Kerr says "Utahraptor, reheat my lobster fillet!"
Utahraptor: No, thank you.  Just - just eat it.
T-Rex: Okay, hold on, I'm gonna go easier.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Aw, Miranda Kerr says "I CAN'T make myself feel better!!  I feel like I've somehow made myself feel... better."
Miranda Kerr: Aw, T-Rex!!
T-Rex: What have I done?
Miranda Kerr: I've learnt a lot from you!
