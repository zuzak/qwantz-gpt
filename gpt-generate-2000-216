T-Rex: Whoo! It's Hallowen and I've already prepared a lot of fun things for when people come to my house for Hallowe'encakes!

T-Rex: For sale is just what I need!

T-Rex: Has everyone come to my house just to get a treat?
Dromiceiomimus: I don't really have any creepy friends, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's not THAT!

Utahraptor: I don't think we're friends, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Well, at least we're not friends.

Utahraptor: T-Rex, if you want to-
T-Rex: Hello! From now on I'm just going to pretend I'm this way!
Utahraptor: Wait!
Utahraptor: Look, I understand why you're yelling. You represent the very limits of our friendship.

T-Rex: But don't abandon the friendship, for better or for worse!
T-Rex: I'm just gonna pretend!
T-Rex: I'm gonna STEAL THE BRITISH STRANGERS FROM T-REX.
