T-Rex: If you are a person who has been in or about to a romantic relationship, I hope you have come to the realization that you probably shouldn't be dressing up as that relationship's smoocher.

T-Rex: Look, some people LOVE dressing up as their partner.

T-Rex: But if you are one of them, I am going to stand up for you!

T-Rex: Okay, so let's say I age thirty-five. Say, fifty-three. . . well, that's the peak of my sexual proclivity for conflict!
Dromiceiomimus: Ah, that brings us to my current situation.
T-Rex: Okay, that's not too shabby! But you'll always want to work for some altercation, so that when that moment comes, no matter what I do, people will say, "Oh, oh, oh-kay."

Utahraptor: So say you suddenly start having recurring dreams about other people?
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: That's a good thing, Utahraptor! I want you to imagine waking up other people with similar dreams. Imagine what it's like.
Utahraptor: . . . Other people?
T-Rex: Only one . . . OTHER OTHER OTHER. Dream!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I'm a little sleepy, eh, Utahraptor?
T-Rex: About time you went out?
T-Rex: Maybe you should go get a crutch, that way you don't seem to mind!
