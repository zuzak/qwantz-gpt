T-Rex: Many a great work of literature has a romance all the way through, and the reader will wonder why they haven't sex with their very lives!

T-Rex: This is because romance is achieved through the application of reader-mate reciprocity!

T-Rex: With love, the reader can help their friends find the romance they need, as long as they don't romance too soon after they get home!
Domiceiomimus: But why is there no mutual respect when there's mutual attraction, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Well, that's one reason why NOT to me!

Utahraptor: T-Rex, what if there was an internal conflict that made you feel bad about yourself for not having sex with your friends earlier?
T-Rex: Man!

T-Rex: That internal conflict can NEVER be fully reconciled with love!
Utahraptor: Yeah, but that internal conflict can never be fully reconciled with love.
T-Rex: Oh man! It can never be fully reconciled with love. MAYBE there was an internal conflict at some point and you've got to just deal with that for the rest of your life.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hey! Remember when I told you my internal conflict was "just" love? Well guess what?
T-Rex: It is finally complete and no longer a internal conflict.
