T-Rex: You, dear reader of my new series of erotica, decided to "watch" a magical box that is constantly being pulled in and out of the room.

T-Rex: It was magical!

T-Rex: It seemed to have a control freak controlling it all, and that was confusing to both the "eyed" and the "underwater" versions of it. It was like - it was all an illusion!
Dromiceiomimus: Aw, T-Rex! I thought you were just going to use the magic to further your own interests!
T-Rex: I'm sorry, Dromiceiomimus, but I don't think I can live in an underwater world.

Utahraptor: Aw, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Why do you have such a vibrant imagination?

Utahraptor: You've always managed to do so much, though - with so many fantastic stories - it's pretty amazing. I always felt as though I was watching a magical box churn endlessly, until eventually, all was lost.
T-Rex: It was truly an amazing story!

Utahraptor: You managed to keep the magic out, though.
T-Rex:Thank you! I was worried that if I was underwater, my voice would be garbled, unable to convey any emotion.
T-Rex: I am going home.
T-Rex: I know!
