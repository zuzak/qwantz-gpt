T-Rex: I will make a documentary about my life!  It will be 2000 years AFTER MY FIRST VISIBLE LIE!

God: THAT'S A LOT OF TIMES
T-Rex: Right.

T-Rex: It will take place on a small screen, on the pavement, and in the darkness.  Small.  A small plane will appear and float above the city.
Dromiceiomimus: A documentary?
T-Rex: Yes, my God!  It will be an ORIGINAL book with all the amazing behind the scenes footage!  The footage will show the characters as they are, themselves, invisible.  It will be amazing, telling an ORIGINAL book full of MORTALS who have TINY NIGHTS to go off of.

Utahraptor: And what of the characters?
T-Rex: They'll be the celebrities!

T-Rex: And the book will tell the story of how I, T-Rex the millionaire, fallible, submissive mistress... but then, incredibly, get out of control and start making money off my mistakes.
Utahraptor: It's a great premise.
T-Rex: It IS.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: HOW COULD A LIE STORY BE SO SMART AND CLEAR?
T-Rex: I will invent a new genre of documentary!
Narrator: "ELLE"
