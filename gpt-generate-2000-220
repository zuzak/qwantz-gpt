T-Rex: I have received complaints. Apparently I cannot properly open a new tab on my computer!

T-Rex: This means that my favourite songs are now BOOBAY BEATS.

T-Rex: It's not okay! It's CRAZY, cats and kittens. I am suddenly dealing with a song that has been ruined by a cat? And the only explanation is that there is something else going on?? I don't know, but I FELL AS if to say "come on what are the odds of screwing up another song?"
T-Rex: FINALLY. I just hope the other musicians start singing their happy ones.

Utahraptor: You know what? I am going to start singing my favourite song.
T-Rex: IT'S THE SONG WITHOUT EVEN GONE MOM.

Utahraptor: You know what? I am going to start CLASSIC SATANIC RACISM.
T-Rex: Yes. I know that's not a bad idea! I will use parody songs as a form of punishment!
T-Rex: However, once that first parody has happened I will no longer be allowed to be controversial! I will no longer be allowed to be CERTAIN.

T-Rex: I will now be PMID "chuggy".
T-Rex: NO REASON, this was an ad for a restaurant in my area. She had a sign saying that Hostess must be the real star of the show.
T-Rex: Oh my god
T-Rex: That IS true
