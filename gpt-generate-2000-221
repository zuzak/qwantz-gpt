T-Rex:  Hello!  I am the lady whom all male characters have to work through because if she weren't for me I Think we might All Fall In Love!

T-Rex:  So here we are, married and single, looking for our first kiss.

T-Rex:  We're having a chat.  She's probably going through some lossy document and Just Imagine If Your Parents Died?  And there's some declaration that says "WARNING: some characters are reading this and are very confused, and may be experiencing MANGER (IN THE SAME WAY THAT A CULTURE WOULD)".  Okay, that one should suffice.  And she's probably going through the same thing too.

T-Rex:  We're all alone tonight.
Utahraptor:  I think the key to sex is communication!

T-Rex:  I'm not sure I'M on board with all that.  I can deal with a lot of things through communication, but I don't think we can successfully operate as effectively as you suggest.
Utahraptor:  ...
T-Rex:  ...What?

T-Rex:  Man, if I were a guy, I'd be really into talking to her.  I could connect with her points of view!  I think it's important.
