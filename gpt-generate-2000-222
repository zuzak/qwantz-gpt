T-Rex: The Internet turns on for a few minutes.

T-Rex: If you're like most people, you've probably spent an average of most of your life online.  But if you log on to the Internet as a newbie, then you've spent an average of most of your life online.  You may have spent an average of most of your life online but you might have spent an average of most of your life online.

T-Rex: Wait a minute!  Aren't we the only ones online?!

T-Rex: If you're like most people, you've probably spent an average of most of your life online.  But if you're like most folks, you've probably spent an average of most of your life online.  If you're like most folks, you've probably been on sites that are often the opposite of what you were there for.
Dromiceiomimus: ...That's true.
T-Rex: Okay!

Utahraptor: I was on...... ...a... ...T-Rex-site?
T-Rex: Okay.

T-Rex: Utahraptor, there's a boxing site you can visit if you want.  And a sex boxing site.  And lots of other things!
Utahraptor: ...Okay.
T-Rex: Okay.

T-Rex: But what if I'm like most folks, and I'm really old?  If I'm like most folks, and I'm really young online, and I've been spammed right out of my parents' basement, and then I'm never going get older?
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: Okay.
