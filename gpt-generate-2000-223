Narrator: T-REX HAS SET HIS FANTASY METAPHOR TO "FUTURE" AND IS STILL LOOKING FOR FUN AT NIGHT
T-Rex: Oh god i was just gonna make it more depressing when the vampires try to get in on the action!

Narrator: THE END

Narrator: COMPRESSED SONG: "SURF CITY" by Twenty-One Pilots
T-Rex: Twenty-One Pilots - you're my friend Twenty-One - you're basically my favourite song, but it's only been for a year!
T-Rex: It is now or never!
T-Rex: Sometime I'll discover that twenty-one Pilots was the song that got me into dressing up really well, and then three weeks later I found out I wasn't super great.

Utahraptor: Twenty-One Pilots - the song Twenty-One said -
T-Rex: TwentyBits.

T-Rex: That's only one song! Twenty-One Pilots played twenty-one songs worth of songs, and then they wrote me the titles!
Utahraptor: That's not very doctor-acy!
T-Rex: Utahraptor I was just warning you!
T-Rex: YOU'RE MY ONE DUDE

Narrator: LATER, IT TURNS OUT TO BE A PERFECT, WISE CONTROL FOR VAMPIRES! WE KILL THE MONA LANGUAGE AND AVOID SOME OF THE STUPID ACTIVITIES YOU'VE IN FOREVER
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!
T-Rex: I'M GOING HOME THANKS FOR THE SURVIVAL
