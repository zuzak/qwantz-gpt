T-Rex: Determinism is the idea that every decision made by us, our brains, and our 'minds' is ultimately responsible for the result!

T-Rex: This determination is referred to as "the disequilibrium principle" or "the non-deterministic dynamical principle".

T-Rex: It follows that every decision is always going to be a bad one for the universe, because if it turns out no decision was made for the universe, then the happy universe that everyone wants to live in is left wanting and empty.
Dromiceiomimus: But not all universes are bad decisions, T-Rex.
T-Rex: But some are good ones!

T-Rex: Consider the problem of raccoons: they're the most efficient mind at anything they're involved in. But when they eat a bunch of food, they drop their hunger on something else: the ground. And this is the problem we're going to solve with determinism.

Utahraptor: So it's just an overloaded brain?
T-Rex: No, in the special case!

T-Rex: If we're going to solve hunger with DEFINITELY DEFINITELY deduction, we need more than an overloaded brain.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, that's not what I meant! I meant, instead, that it contains some VERY special properties.
T-Rex: Consider the universe...

T-Rex: Aha! And that's one way of looking at it!
T-Rex: That's a property that goes unappreciated, though!
