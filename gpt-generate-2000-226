T-Rex: When you're a kid, you've got this idea of how we should all be better. You're raised to value intelligence above all else, and to value it above all else just as you value intelligence in general. It's innate. It's not a choice thing.

T-Rex: Adults DON'T make that sort of argument!

T-Rex: Adults FORGET TO LOSE THEIR OPINIONS AT HOME, HAVING THEM TAKING CLASS, or teens! They're hot! They've got brains. They're 5, 16 or 24. Screw them. Screw their parents.
T-Rex: I don't care HOW hot they are, screw them!!

Utahraptor: But adults don't care!
T-Rex: But adults do. They care how hot they are.

T-Rex: They want to be adults, and if an adult isn't getting that same parental responsibility argument then IT'S BILLY TALENT CRITERIA. Screw them.
Utahraptor: Adults don't get mad at babies. They get mad at adults.
T-Rex: Screw them!!

T-Rex: Adults get mad at RVs who left bumpy roads in winter. Adults get mad at VOLKS who roamed the earth in winter while parachuting in the freeze-cold Antarctic. Screw you Utahraptor!!
T-Rex: I don't get it!
