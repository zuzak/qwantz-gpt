T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate wacky trick! Every time I turn up the thermostat on my stove, there's a wacky little green guy with a turbine for suckers to find at the bottom! He's about 5'10" and around 180 pounds. 

T-Rex: He's also got this turbine for suckers, yes?

T-Rex: Aw, he's a TOTALLY CERTAIN guy. 
Dromiceiomimus: Aw, yeah! 
T-Rex: He's 5'11". 

Utahraptor: So we go to the grocery store and there's this smart yellow guy who comes with the store's wacky little green guy?

T-Rex: YES, he's TRULY the best wacky trick yet!

Utahraptor: I'm not sure this is one of those "hidden extras" that people get when they pay money to have their name on a shopping list. 

Narrator: MEANWHILE, AT THE TOP OF HIS OPINION
T-Rex: How can you possibly be so wrong??
