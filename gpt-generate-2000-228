T-Rex: I had the strangest dream last night...

T-Rex: It was crazy!

T-Rex: My friends were going through work and I was this big guy with big dreams, and dreams, and big dreams. Dreams were making me T-Rex over and over.
T-Rex: I don't remember much of this dream, but it was pretty memorable!

Utahraptor: So, what happened?
T-Rex: I woke up and I threw up on the floor!

T-Rex: And that's what robbed me of all self-control and of any self-control to lucid dreaming.
Utahraptor: Dreams don't just happen; I dreamed I'd been dreaming when I was younger.
T-Rex: What makes you think you could dream of such amazing things?

T-Rex: It seemed like an opportunity...
