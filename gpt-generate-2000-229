T-Rex: I've been working on a script: a web card for traders. It will tell the ultimate story of how, IN THE YEAR 65, 

T-Rex: when the Titanic sank, the only thing that could have saved us all is hindsight, because hindsight is always 20/20!

T-Rex: We are all dead
T-Rex: but we're not alone

T-Rex: hindsight is a precious resource that we will always have. We'll always have. We'll always keep kicking and screaming because that resource was, and will be, a TRILLION DOLLAR WISE.
T-Rex: So our only chance of survival is through trading those early death-cakes in the year 65!

Utahraptor: Maybe it's better to live as if everything went wrong before you even had a chance to set it up.
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: And maybe that will change? Maybe you'll build a new, stronger AI to beat the Hallowe'en vision and you'll prevent all trades from going to waste, instead taking advantage of the incredibly fragile and dying 1970s 1930s 1930s 1930s Frankenstein-esque 20th-century 18th-century 18th century 18th century 20th century 20th century 20th century 20th century 20th century 20th century

T-Rex: ...Yes?
Utahraptor: Yes!
T-Rex: I just thought it was cool that you wanted to live in the year 65.
Utahraptor: I got that, yeah! Weird how we all keep trying to get inside your head!
T-Rex: Man, hindsight always counts!
