T-Rex: My stars, I have been so busy lately!

T-Rex: Oh no, my emails!

T-Rex: They've all been "Hey, check out my new calendar: the sick weeks!! Darn it, it's super convenient, you can cancel now and take it back."
T-Rex: ("Cancel" sounds real nice!)

T-Rex: "Y'all be late for the doctor appointment, medicine is kinda creepy, isn't it?"
Utahraptor: "Oh man, I forgot about that!"

T-Rex: "Y'all be all up for an untimely death, thanks to the "emerald" we use in the show! Will the "emerald" actually mean "short story", STAT" is just a nickname someone gives to their next best friends?"
T-Rex: "WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT, HUH?"

T-Rex: oh my god YES
T-Rex: WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT, HUH
