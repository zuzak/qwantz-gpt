T-Rex: I've been thinking, and I've come up with the best way to think...

T-Rex: Think Like A Dude!

Dromiceiomimus: Don't you mean "Think Like A Dude??" 
T-Rex: Oh yeah, that's exactly how I do it! In real life, as soon as I think about what I want and don't want, I stop! But that doesn't mean I have to give up any desire to be friends!
Dromiceiomimus: ESPECIALLY if that's the case...

Utahraptor: I think it's MORE practical!
T-Rex: Precisely?

Utahraptor: Yeah, and that stops you from wanting or not wanting to friends. Say, if you wanted to meet for dinner but you'd rather that things be more like a race, you wouldn't. You'd instead set out to meet up some other now-roommate and find out what you'd be doing instead.
T-Rex: Hooray!

Narrator: BUT IT WENT TOWARDS SUCCESS:
T-Rex: I still think it's actually a good idea!
