T-Rex: Okay, so I'd like to eat a sandwich, so sandwichitz.com.

T-Rex: Now I'm not eating a sandwich, but that doesn't mean I understand why

T-Rex: Anyway, I'm sure I understand why sandwichitz.com.

T-Rex: So here's the deal: you've got a website up, right? You've got a tag line saying "sandwich for the punctuation marks"? And you've got a button, so when you press it, the website will bring you a new article that explains why the punctuation marks between mean only mean something different from the punctuation between articles.

Utahraptor: And you want to sell the website to someone else?
T-Rex: I WANT TO LIVE IN A WEISS, MASSACHUSETTE, AND SISTINE HISTORY ON HOUSES!!

T-Rex: And it's my idea, unless they give me a leave of absence from another safe haven!
Utahraptor: These are good things to have in your house, but they make you less likely to go out in the world! Also, you get to mold your furniture, which also increases the chance of rust.

Narrator: LATER, T-REX IS LEARNING ABOUT SOME REALLY IMPORTANT STUFF: STICKS THAT ACTUALLY HAPPEN TO BURN OFF COLLISION??
T-Rex: Aw man! Turns out I have like a quarter of a nickel in my wallet??
T-Rex: Also, the rest of the staff keeps bumping me about.
