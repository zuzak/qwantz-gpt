T-Rex: Let us start with the assumption that not all people can create beautiful things!

T-Rex: We are basically DESCRIBING everyone else to do the same thing.

T-Rex: Look at an expensive car that can only be owned by the few, wealthy few at the top! You can't buy a better, more desirable expensive car. And look at the problem from the opposite direction: you can buy a car that is as beautiful as possible and that can only be owned by the few, wealthy few at the bottom?

T-Rex: Pretty sure that if I bought a car that was as beautiful as possible until I was no longer truly happy with it, I'd be buying a car that was as worthless as I could no longer own!
Utahraptor: Hey, maybe you should check off your horizons, my friend!

Utahraptor: I'm not sure that you should!  If you're in the position of someone you can only own once they've achieved at least a certain level of desirability, this is a very bad situation.
T-Rex: EXACTLY. Check it out, Utahraptor.  You'll be a pretty nice car... WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE DISTINCT.

Narrator: LATER, AT THE ROAD T-REX AND UTAHRAPTOR:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Today I ran into Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: Hello!
T-Rex: Hey!
T-Rex: I'm T-Rex and Utahraptor's son!  We're both 18.
