T-Rex: A TRUE story, my friends, which relies upon your emotional intelligence!

T-Rex: A STORY WHICH KIND OF SUCKS TO THE NORM

T-Rex: A Story With A Christmas Carol Autobiography by myself, T-Rex! Do you have any stories?
Dromiceiomimus: I have some, T-Rex!
T-Rex: GREATEST HATERS

Utahraptor: Wait - earlier, about your book?
T-Rex: No, that one just got a whole lot more interesting!

T-Rex: A WORD JUST FOR LETS JUST SAY "LIES"
Utahraptor: Alright, better.
T-Rex: Okay! Okay, okay, I'm going to say "word" and you'rehers are mandatory. Now the good news: I invented a second form of speech, one which relies upon our emotional intelligence. Now the wait is NEVER FILLING. We'll be able to sleep without our first words, or even just a sentence, and that's a huge step towards language comprehension!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Today I learnt a valuable life lesson: that no story can be complete without mentioning a single thought!
T-Rex: That thought was: "Ben got shot down!"
