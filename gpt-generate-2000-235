T-Rex: Today is the day I write an amazing sequel to somebody else's book. Yes, I will do that. 

T-Rex: I THINK I AM GOING TO WRITE A SPOILER ALRIGHT, THIS IS THE MOST VALUABLE SUPERMAN STORY IN THE APOCALYPSE.

T-Rex: Awesome! So awesome!! 
Dromiceiomimus: Aw, I'm not sure how Superman feels about that, T-Rex. 
T-Rex: He kinda wants to feel like he's the last Batman, the last Bruce Wayne, the last Bruce Wayne walking the Earth as he were. 

Utahraptor: That's - That's not what Superman wants, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Is he just that SPECIAL?

T-Rex: He wants to feel like he's last post-apocalyptic Bruce Wayne, stomping on things and getting revenge from Superman for his father's murder. 
Utahraptor: ...Perhaps...
T-Rex: YES. 

Narrator: LATER, T-REX IS RUNNING TO THE WALL, AND THROUGH THE WALL He Is Setting Free the Caged Bird!
T-Rex: The Caged Bird!!
T-Rex: I am so happy I found this website!
