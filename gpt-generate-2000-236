T-Rex: It's time to make some changes in how I live my life!  I'm going to wake up and think "I totally don't care for people with pre-existing medical conditions!"

T-Rex: And then, I'm going to do some of the following:

T-Rex: Change my mind; go to bed and think "I totally don't care for people with pre-existing medical conditions!"

T-Rex: Change my mind; go to bed and think "I totally don't care for people with pre-existing medical conditions!"
Dromiceiomimus: Those are terrible.
T-Rex: And yet, I still think "I totally do not care for people with pre-existing medical conditions!"

Utahraptor: These aren't "I totally do not care about people with pre-existing medical conditions!" signs!
T-Rex: That's it!  Utahraptor, I am changing my mind!

T-Rex: Change my bedtime poem so it's "I totally do not care about people with pre-existing medical conditions!"
Utahraptor: Change my mind; I don't mean to imply that you DO.
T-Rex: Well, I do!  I am altering the nature of my thinking to make me feel good!

T-Rex: Well, I do!  I am altering the nature of my thinking to make me feel good!
