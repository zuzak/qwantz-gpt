Narrator: today's technique: CORRECTING PRESENTATION
T-Rex: What's a cuss?

T-Rex: An incorrect substitution is confusing and often results in a more interesting conversation! For example: "What'd Gary do?"
Dromiceiomimus: Is that what he said he was going to do after he got off the boat?
T-Rex: Yes!
T-Rex: Gary said he'd get off the boat BEFORE he got on.
Dromiceiomimus: Okay!

Utahraptor: And that's what you do?
T-Rex: Well, correct substitution is more interesting and more concerned with our mindsets!

T-Rex: You're largely looking for meaning by ignoring important facts, and that's what we want from language!
Utahraptor: Well, that's one thing we're really good at.
T-Rex: That's the other thing we're really good at!
