T-Rex: I know a lot about Super Mario!

T-Rex: Or should I say... I really know a lot about them?

T-Rex: Here are some things I've never heard of: high school slang?
Dromiceiomimus: Oh, that's no such thing!  All I've heard are jokes about the "Nine Muses", or the "Nine Muses of La Salle de Cinco de Cinco", pronounced "ME-noo-seal"!
T-Rex: JE I D E S T U D E N

Utahraptor: T-Rex, did you hear that one?
T-Rex: I did not!

Utahraptor: Okay, some things I've never heard of: it's an amateur sport!  It's not "the racetrack"!
T-Rex: Utahraptor, that's exactly what I'm going to say!  Okay, let's see what's going on!
Utahraptor: Well, I mean, it's not like it's much.  There's tons of hidden gambling elements.

T-Rex: Gambling elements?
T-Rex: Gambling elements!
T-Rex: I just want to see what's going on!
