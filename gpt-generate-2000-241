T-Rex: I have just discovered a way to remember EVERYTHING that ever happened that I've EVER MADE! All my memories, tastes, and dreams forever!

T-Rex: Everyone alive today can easily remember EVERYTHING, and anyone who doesn't have an internet connection can never remember anything.

T-Rex: All I need to do is create an imaginary friend who remembers EVERYTHING for him, and then, when he grows up, they'll all go to an unrelated event to reminisce!
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, this idea of remembering everything ever could be really useful, even if you're not your STUFF self.
T-Rex: Isn't that the problem with real life, Dromiceiomimus? When people go back in time to do something horrible, doing something SO LITERATE that they're no longer responsible?

Utahraptor: I disagree, my friend!
T-Rex: What's that?

Utahraptor: With our current technology, at least, we can't legally remember things that were actually done in the past. It's just not true.
T-Rex: I concede your point, friend! But, on the other hand, I think we can all get close to come up with some pretty neat illusions.

Narrator: MANY OF THE FOLLOWING MEMORIES HAVE BECOME STUPID:
T-Rex: Cuteness!
T-Rex: Apparate!
