Narrator: THE PRIVATE STORY
T-Rex: It's a secret Agent Cooper loves, but that's changing...

T-Rex: ...UNABLE TO SAY.

T-Rex: It's a story I'm telling the whole world, Dromiceiomimus!  You'll be telling your MOST EXPENSIVE TELLERS when you finally get them to reveal the secret.  And I'll be the first to say "boo hoo!" and they'll say "What the hell, everyone."  Then they'll stop listening and start running around with their mouths wide open.
Dromiceiomimus: Wait.  I'm not sure what this is all about.
T-Rex: No, it's all about running down the story lane.

Utahraptor: Wow, this is going to be great!  I'm excited!
T-Rex: Hooray!!

T-Rex: Agents: you're going to write the whole story down in your notebook for future reference!  You'll have up to eight pages of the full story, but if you don't have eight pages, you can use a combination of two spaced character archetypes.
Utahraptor: That's a character stereotype!
T-Rex: i have SO MANY STRANGERS that y'all KNOW)

Narrator: THE END
