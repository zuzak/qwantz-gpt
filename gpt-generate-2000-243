T-Rex: I think I will have to go on a trip around the world. For now, anyway.
T-Rex: For now!

T-Rex: For now!

T-Rex: For now I intend on making this trip as successful as possible. It will be to some obscure village, encountering some locals who have never travelled, encountering some tourists from the skies above the capital, Damascus!
T-Rex: Huh.

Utahraptor: If you ever visit that country, I'm not sure that's going to be a bad idea!
T-Rex: Oh, sure!

T-Rex: But it will probably be a bad idea just to try and get there, and to save face when I ask. Anyway!
Utahraptor: Then you'll be the tourist, and I'll have to ask you for your IDENTITY.
T-Rex: Thanks!

T-Rex: But since tourism is the blood of millions of travellers, I can't blame them for wanting to find me!
T-Rex: But since MY IDENTITY is their IDENTITY, I can't blame them for wanting to help me get there!
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: But since tourism is the blood of millions of travellers
