T-Rex: I am a guy who likes to keep my SECRET MOUTHLY SECRET STUFF A PART of my job.

T-Rex: Okay so I DO like to keep secrets, but sometimes I write them down in plain sight.

T-Rex: For instance, let's say I want to know if someone loves someone. Say I want to know if that person has a sweetie or a hot mic!
Dromiceiomimus: Sweet?
T-Rex: Sweet!  And I can find out more with a simple "You know what?".  Or say I want to know if that hot person has a secret and you know I should do more research!

Utahraptor: But what if that person doesn't have a sweetie or a hot mic?
T-Rex: That would be a corporate lie!

T-Rex: That is a moral corporate lie.  I would call that a corporate lie!  I believe that would be a corporate lie!  I believe that would be moral.  I believe that would be religious.  I believe that I would share that belief with all my friends.
Utahraptor: Okay!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary!  You know what?  I've actually COMPLETELY forgotten my taxes and a bunch of stuff.  When I get home I'll make a big deal about taxes, because nobody will believe me for the rest of my life.
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: ...Okay
