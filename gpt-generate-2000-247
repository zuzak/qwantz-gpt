Narrator: DINO CHUCKLES

T-Rex: Who wants some jerk jerk action?

T-Rex: Oh my GOSH I am going to start a mailing list for jerky jerk jerk action guys! If you have ever had a friend join a jerky jerk jerk action group, please, stop now. It will take T-Rex just to take a picture. I'll ask him what his favourite genre is and get a reply saying "I think we've all got to die young, my friends will grow up to be great men and women, and I'm afraid I don't want to live down that fairy tale any longer!"

Utahraptor: But there's no magic number there!
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: Magic means that when you do join a jerky jerk action group, THOSE guys will all get together and say "Okay man, this is a very important number and let's get it straightened out."
Utahraptor: Magic being an important number, I don't know - are we...? Wizards? Ancients? OR SINCE, QUANTUM ENUALS??

T-Rex: Um, are we...literally...?
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: [[off-panel]] Yes we are. [[Off-panel]] [[Whisper]] [[Speech impediment]] [[Speech loop]]
