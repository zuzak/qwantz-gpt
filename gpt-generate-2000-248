T-Rex: Hey guys!
T-Rex: I just wrote down everything I really want to say and put it on a fridge!

T-Rex: INSIDE THE FRIDGE!

Dromiceiomimus: What?
Dromiceiomimus: I'm not sure what to tell you.  you're a friggin' baby!
T-Rex: I'm telling you!  I'm writing myself out in the middle of a sentence and suddenly I'm hearing it again.
Dromiceiomimus: Aw, excellent!!

Utahraptor: Isn't that a chilling effect, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Yes.

T-Rex: And I think that if I were writing a book called "Come On Dromiceiomimus, We've DONE It!" then you'd hear that song a lot, but you'd never suspect that anything is amiss!
Utahraptor: It's a chilling effect though!

T-Rex: Yes, it is.  I'm writing it as if I, as T-Rex, am being watched on THE INTERNET.
T-Rex: AND I'M SLEEPING ON THE INTERNET LIKE I'M NOT AT ALL AT ALL
