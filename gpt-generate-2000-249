T-Rex: I have decided that I will put my tremendous height, strength, abilities, intellect, and intelligence to good use today.

T-Rex: I will fight crime, and shall win the lottery!

T-Rex: And THAT'S all I need to know about the lottery, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: How do you... train?
T-Rex: Um... mostly first?
T-Rex: First place: TOYS!!

Utahraptor: Hey, I taught you how to train, T-Rex!
T-Rex: WHAT?

Utahraptor: Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot you were here. Instead, I'll tell you how I've put together a little robot suit. First you need to robot up your enemies, and then you'll need to build up an army of TOYS.
T-Rex: That sounds really awesome!
Utahraptor: You don't need to make up words; you can just write one down.

T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Today I learnt a valuable life lesson: trust your gut.
T-Rex: Ladies and gentlemen: trust your gut!!
