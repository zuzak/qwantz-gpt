T-Rex: I love adult simulators. They're not like regular simulators, where you can model your own development curve and figure out how fast things will get in the future. They're...

T-Rex: ...they're not!

T-Rex: They're simulations where you give a sim a few minutes of your life spent playing basketball, and the result is a game that'll make you rich and famous!
Dromiceiomimus: Aren't these just educational simulations, T-Rex?
T-Rex: No, those games are just...

Utahraptor: They're both completely functional!
T-Rex: Yes! And I find them to be wholly fun!

T-Rex: You get mad at your imaginary best friend and then the game is over, you're rich and famous, and your imaginary best friend is stomping on every ol' building in the game's path!
Utahraptor: I played basketball while playing basketball!
T-Rex: Yes!
T-Rex: I'm glad we're friends
