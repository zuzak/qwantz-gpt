Narrator: T-REX HAS published TWO GRADUATIONS FOR MEN. THE first is for them to apologise to T-Rex after he punches out a couple of women! The second is for them to apologise to each other after they break up with each other!

T-Rex: Oh goodness.

T-Rex: Okay, so MEN need to crack up because if we're going to have a normal and happy sex, we need to do it in good time. So, in this time, let's give thanks in the pantomime.
Dromiceiomimus: Thanks, T-Rex!
T-Rex: With my thanks, I... am now at a good place!
Dromiceiomimus: Thanks, T-Rex!

T-Rex: But let's be serious! If I'm going to be forgiven, it's better I just break up with each of them.
Utahraptor: Congratulations, man!

Utahraptor: You're no longer meant to be forgiven.  You're lost in feelings of loss and desolation.
T-Rex: Now I know why!
Utahraptor: I'm sorry, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's okay; I just feel bad for breaking up with you
