T-Rex: I've been thinking, and I've come to the conclusion that a guy called "Johnny" is the best friend I can name.

T-Rex: He's THE friend I never had!

T-Rex: So I've been wondering why you keep making such strong and compelling arguments for the existence of Johnny! Why not ask him about Star Trek NOW?
Dromiceiomimus: Because it'll be fascinating, and the only plausible reason you're keeping it secret is because nobody will ever find it interesting!
T-Rex: True!

Utahraptor: If Johnny wants Trek to remain secret, why are you hiding it from everyone?
T-Rex: Huh?

Utahraptor: Why are you playing this game of catch-up and paradox, where the greatest adventure is the one that finallys succeeds when all adventure is effectively pulled by one single party?
T-Rex: Huh? Oh, if I were to play it on my own, it'd be fascinating. I should learn more!

Narrator: 45 MINUTES LATER...
T-Rex: Excuse me! Why am I here?
T-Rex: I'm here to read a chapter of Star Trek, and there's only one answer:
T-Rex: I'm here to read "PARTICULAR"
