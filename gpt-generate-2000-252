T-Rex: One day Joe was asked by a newspaperman if he was a racist, and he said he wasn't!  Joe was very angry, and so I asked if he was!  He smiled and said he was a good guy, and I told him.  He said he was!  He went into the newspaper office and sat down.

T-Rex: "I'm not a racist!" Joe said!

T-Rex: Joe's words stunned me, because I was deeply involved in a case of the newspaper.  I believed him when I said that I had never said racist things, and yet -
Dromiceiomimus: - you did!  You believe Joe is racist now.
T-Rex: Joe!  I believe you too!  I have faith in you in this situation.

Utahraptor: You're not racist, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Not REALLY!  But I have faith in you in a small number of things, but I don't believe Joe is racist right now.

T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: Joe, you should ask your friends what they think.  What would they think, if they real believed you were?
T-Rex: Joe, I'm racist!  I'm racist!
