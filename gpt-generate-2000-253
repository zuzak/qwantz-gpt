Narrator: GUESS THE FIRST SENTENCE FROM YOUR BODY THAT MAKES YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'RE HAPPY?
T-Rex: The answer is "HELLO!"

T-Rex: Whew! Fatally!

T-Rex: It's the first of several plots that I'm not going to spoil! She lives on a beach, so she can party!
Dromiceiomimus: I prefer that you give the audience something to remember her up at the beach, like a note thanking her for her drink, a circle of friends, a picture of peach fuzz, or a picture of a head and neck made of fuzzy pixilated plastic.
T-Rex: (What? Is there not a picture of a fuzzy pix?)

Utahraptor: From a rhetorical perspective, there's no benefit to be had by taking a picture of a bumpy beach and turning it into a speech.
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: But from a physiological perspective, it's kind of funny because bumpy sand is sort of a watery 'n' beach. There's a physiological effect on the brain that's just there to smooth out any congestion you get.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, being fat AND having a bumpy sand beach is funny.

LATER:
T-Rex: What the heck, my friend, how do you even respond to a text posted to a website where it's instantly obvious just by looking at it that I'm talking about my husband not liking peaches mashed up in a mashed up boat
