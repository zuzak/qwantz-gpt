T-Rex: I am a guy who likes to make plans, sometimes sometimes sometimes not enough food.  I make plans sometimes and sometimes I don't.

T-Rex: Plan A, meet Plan B!

T-Rex: Okay, it's time for some excellent Plan B!  In this case, I... get some sleep?
T-Rex: Whatever!  I'm going to make Plan C the day after I lose my last pound of flesh and get this plan accomplished!

Utahraptor: This is terrible!
T-Rex: Whatever!  I'm going to totally lose this plan this week, and then I'm going to totally gain the ability to plan actions and make those actions the result of those actions being taken, and worse!

Utahraptor: No, T-Rex, you got this.  You just found my secret!  You're going to be the best person to have this plan accomplished for sure, tonight.
T-Rex: Thanks!
T-Rex: I'm still super sleepy tonight, baby!
