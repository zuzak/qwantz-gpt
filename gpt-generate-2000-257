T-Rex: "Dear Dromiceiomimus: My name is 'The Rescued Star' and I'm a chick who wants to be a doctor but doesn't know if she has one. I voted you guys a sandwich!"
Utahraptor: T-Rex! That's me!!
T-Rex: "Dear Dromiceiomimus: My name is 'The Invenible 'Ooze'"!

T-Rex: "Dear Dromiceiomimus: My name is 'The Stabby'!"
T-Rex: "Dear Dromiceiomimus: My name is 'The Booomatous'!"
