T-Rex: The future!

T-Rex: Folks are going to have to say "rare things to reliably find things to say! OLDS. I AM HONEST. I AM SO DOWN. I AM A LITTLE KIND OF A RUBBOT. WOULD YOU like to know what you think?!" or "WHAT A TRICK."?
T-Rex: That is the best answer I HAVE HOPE FOR AN ADULT TO GIVE HIM/HER.

Utahraptor: You're not rapping about being a stupid dog isn't it?
T-Rex: What? No!

Utahraptor: Well, why not? You're not rapping about how awesome being a stupid dog is, that we have this great team of scientists working for us, that if you were actually walking around saying that, it would be ridiculous.
T-Rex: Holy crap.

T-Rex: There's a time and a place for that kind of rapping!
