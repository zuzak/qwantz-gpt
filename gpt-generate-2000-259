T-Rex: The Occult Science Fiction Emcee "The Nun"! ("The Nun") is a USUAL tectonic plates deviation that occurs when travelling in a "V" shaped arc. USUAL

T-Rex: Also known as: a zero plate "V" (as it's more popular), the "V" is a non-canonical rotating planet that's not actually a planet. It's called a "zero plate" because the "V" inside it doesn't actually move.
Dromiceiomimus: But then why do we call it a planet?
T-Rex: It's a planet! Also - why do we call it a planet that sucks at killing before it sucks at EATING you?

Utahraptor: Or why we call it a planet that only eats when at risk?
T-Rex: USUAL

T-Rex: Or perhaps we could justategorize the planet as:
Utahraptor: "That Chubby Cheetah Told Me He'd Eat You If (That Chubby Cheetah Really Said That)", or "That Chubby Cheetah Really Regreted It In The End For The Wicked Stewards, That They Could Not Hasten The Universe's Progress".

Utahraptor (from off): Yes; sorry, that was off the record; sorry again
T-Rex: I didn't say anything inappropriate!
T-Rex: W-
T-Rex: WHAT THE HECK
