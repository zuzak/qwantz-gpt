Narrator: T-REX IN: "WRAPPING PRESENTS IN THE PLASTIC BAGS THEY CAME IN"
T-Rex: It's been a memorable two weeks indeed!

T-Rex: Do you miss the prospect of making old friends, knowing that at least some of them still really like you?

Dromiceiomimus: But what do you miss?
T-Rex: The chance to talk about new things that haven't been covered in the media, like the totally awesome new catchphrases that are now superfluous to both the author and the reader!

Utahraptor: T-Rex, the past is entirely new!
T-Rex: SO AWESOME!

T-Rex: And the new catchphrases are superfluous to both the author and the reader! Hah hah! I don't like it when you write about something that hasn't been covered in print!
Utahraptor: Hah hah! I don't like it when you write about something that hasn't been COOL with a girl?

T-Rex: Hah hah hah!
