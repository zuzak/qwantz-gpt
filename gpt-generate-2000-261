T-Rex: My favourite sentence processing technique is LINQ. It's a powerful technique when you're learning it in grade three and it's still really fun to program in natural language processing. But what if you had a more natural brain type, like a|> or a|>? What if you did a|> and processed the sentence in question, but one sentence was processed first, and that sentence is still valid even though you say it's different?

T-Rex: I'd be doomed!

T-Rex: I'd be SERIOUSLY the worst person to do machine-assisted sentence processing.
Utahraptor: What if the sentence was processed by just ONE person, then?

Utahraptor: Then you can't ever have 100% truth, because that sentence is still AWKWARDLY formed!
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: And if I'd only had one person to run the processing loop on, that person could tell me how the sentence came to be, and it's still AWKWARDLY formed.
Utahraptor: True!
T-Rex: I'm not saying one person to one, but I'm certainly not saying one person to one.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN A PARALLEL "FORK" UNIVERSE:
Mosquito: I've got another word for this, mosquitos.
T-Rex: It's a term that means "small mammal" but you know what it means?
Mosquito: WE'RE STOPPING AT The Kill!
T-Rex: Don't worry; I'll just REMEMBER IT.
