T-Rex: It's time for some embarrassing stories!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus found out a horrible truth...

T-Rex: Years ago, when she was 12 years old, she was murdered! 
T-Rex: 20 years ago!

T-Rex: That's 14 murders in 14 years, Utahraptor. 
T-Rex: 14 murders, assuming you keep track of how many people Dromiceiomimus murdered, that's -
T-Rex: 15 murders.

T-Rex: That's another 15 murders in the future, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: You keep going over the murders you think are important? 

T-Rex: I keep thinking of how OLD I am, Utahraptor. 
T-Rex: What if I don't define 10 years ago as a "thriller" or even a "15th century financial services fraud"? 

T-Rex: What if I just punch someone in the face in a bar and they screamed, "HI?  WE'RE SUBORDINATED?  WHO'LL TEEL OFF WITH OUR BETS???"
T-Rex: What if I just hold up a picture of a gun and say "I'll be a guy holding a gun"?
