Narrator: T-REX IN: "WRAPPING PRESENTS IN YOUR PLACE"
T-Rex: It's a beautiful day!

T-Rex: I love the way you oranges shade out past your green.  It's beautiful, but now you're staring into space, paralyzed by the worry you might die someday: will you die, or will you rise again?  You gaze out at the void, aching, unable to move, waiting to be overcome.  It's a beautiful image, a girl in a bikini, you can kiss her and tell, but now her consciousness needs you to kiss her too.  You're trying to kiss her, you're touching.  It's going to be beautiful.

Utahraptor: Hey, I tried to kiss her!
T-Rex: But you're not letting go, my friend!

Utahraptor: You're a little crazy, my friend! You wanted to kiss her, but it was a mistake.  You're a kisser, and you should stop.
T-Rex: She's right! I should kiss her right now!

Narrator: 45 MINUTES LATER:
T-Rex: Sheesh, my friend!  It was a stupid mistake, and I'm sorry!  I don't want this to become a movie.
T-Rex: Let's do it!
