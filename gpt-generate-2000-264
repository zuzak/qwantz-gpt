T-Rex: Has anyone ever heard of a group called the "Nine Inch Nails"?

T-Rex: Perhaps they go by the more commonly-used "Nine Inch Nails Interscope", which is, of course, a measurement of a person's true worth.
Dromiceiomimus: A "Nine Inch" is a measurement of strength?
T-Rex: Strength which, again, is expressed in terms of a pound-for-pound weight-on-pound mass-adding feat!

Utahraptor: Well, MAYBE there's no magical number to measure strength, T-Rex!
T-Rex: MAYBE it's called... CONSTANTLY.

T-Rex: Strength isn't just a number on a board; it's a measure of self-confidence.
Utahraptor: And strength isn't just a number on a scale of "100", it's a measure of self-confidence as a person of THAT level.
T-Rex: Well, you're making a joke about me?
T-Rex: I'm not joking!

T-Rex: Strength isn't just a number on a number, it's a measure of self-discipline.
T-Rex: Well, you're making a joke about me?
T-Rex: I'm not joking?
