T-Rex: Today I came across your hilarious essay parody.
T-Rex: Oh boy!

T-Rex: It's so well-thought-out that my hilarious skit today I'm going to be a stand-up comedian!

T-Rex: It's a series of segments on the car used for some repair work. The cars are put in reverse when the wheels slip.
T-Rex: Right!  It was so well-thought-out!

Utahraptor: So let's hear your hilarious sketch!
T-Rex: It will be excellent!

Utahraptor: Okay, so listen: I'm not convinced that a car is a "stranded" car in and of itself is not a "stranded" car. On the other hand, some sort of structure could be, and it would be hilarious!
T-Rex: Then what's comedy?
Utahraptor: What's comedy?

T-Rex: Comedy means we're entertained, and I think that comedy truly comes from nature.
T-Rex: That's what I thought!
