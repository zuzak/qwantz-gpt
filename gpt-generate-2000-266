Narrator: "TO THE FUTURE" - THE BOOK THAT TOLD THE STORY
T-Rex: I am going to invent the Future, and I'm going to make him a good friend.  I'm going to make him an assassin so he can kill future criminals.

T-Rex: And I'm going to make him a super-speed sailor so he can fight in the sea.

T-Rex: And I'm going to make him a robot to take our robots around the world and put them in stasis.  And I'm going to make him a space robot to send us into space in our now fully assembled space ambulance!
Dromiceiomimus: Space ambulance?  How familiar are you with it?
T-Rex: I don't know - it's one of those taxis you take the cab to, sometimes you can park it in the back of a building, and then you put the car in the ground.

Utahraptor: So how does it work?
T-Rex: Robot, once you know it!

T-Rex: It works like this. You pick up a driver and he's our "future friend" and he's our driving instructor. Then you let him drive the cab up and down the road and you let him try to park it at the top of the stairs at all times.  And when he has the basic idea of what the heck the heck the heck the heck the heck the heck...

T-Rex: The doors open up into the sky and the astronaut looks out into the night, smiling and holding a glass of water.
Utahraptor: Wow.  This story sounds pretty terrific.
T-Rex: I know, I know! I love it!  And now I'm going to make it better.

T-Rex: Captain Starship announces that the mission has brought them to the right destination: the International Space Station!
Utahraptor: Oh no.  The astronauts have a DWI of 0.8200 and the door is unlocked.  The guy who opens it has the potential to shoot down the very words of Shakespeare!
T-Rex: Shakespeare!  Do you think Shakespeare is out for a walk?
