Narrator: ONE DAY:
T-Rex: I have the greatest idea for a children's book. It's a WWII US Military adventure story! 

God: DUDE THAT'S LITERALLY THE WORST
T-Rex: I'm going to invent a verb for it, just so it doesn't mean I mean "Make fun of the stupid thing he's about to do".
God: T-REX THAT'S LITERALLY THE WORST
Narrator: THE END

Utahraptor: You're going to have to pay $100 to have your book made?
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: It's a small price to pay for the LEGIT EXPANSION OF YOUR OLD BOOK. But you'll MILLIONAL units be required for this amazing series of books, and millions of dollars will determine the future of this amazing young man!
Utahraptor: Your Old Book will be forgotten, forever!

Narrator: "LATER: 
T-Rex: A Nobel Prize Committee Award for Excellence in the Use of Verb Generators in a Change from Sentence to Verb Generator."
T-Rex: That's it!  Done. Go do something else.
