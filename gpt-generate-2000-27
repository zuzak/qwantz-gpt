Narrator: T-REX IN: "WRITING MEDIA SEX: PRETTY OLD FASHION"
T-Rex: In my spare time I've written a really erotic poem called "FASHION TALENT II".

T-Rex: The title is sexy!

T-Rex: It's a sartorialist rip off of a lot of the rest of the book, but with some pretty advanced changes. The style and imagery is impressive, and the book itself is pretty terrific.
Dromiceiomimus: Is the poem "punktastic"?
T-Rex: It's a good poem, Dromiceiomimus!

Utahraptor: Are you writing a non-rhyming rehash of your bestselling work?
T-Rex: No, of course not!

T-Rex: I think what I'm doing here is trying to sell a new book for less than the old one! I'm trying to sell a book that, if you agree, can be summarized into a few pages.
Utahraptor: "You're a good dude, T-Rex."

T-Rex: "Somehow I've succeeded at all these hard tasks and still it's way more fun to be a sucky person than a sucky reader!!"
T-Rex: [[whispers]] Aww!
