T-Rex: Hey God! Check out my new video game!
God: WHAT

T-Rex: I invented it just to watch movies

T-Rex: So what the hell, God? This is no life lesson! I'm just going to teach you how to ESPECIALLY play your favorite movie. 
God: UM
T-Rex: It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" movie! 

Utahraptor: It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" movie! 
T-Rex: TRUE. But what's interesting is that it's set in an alternate Earth, so the game plays out the same way! 
Utahraptor: And the ultimate goal is to win this game! 
T-Rex: Yes! 

T-Rex: So we start out on a small, alien world called "Mr. Omega" and increase in size until we're a gorgeous, sexy woman in sexy clothing who is sexy. 
God: T-REX I WAS ASKING BECAUSE I NEED A WINNER
T-Rex: So we get to see this woman in sexy clothes compete with a video game that has no women and who constantly tells us how sexy he is!
God: HONESTLY
T-Rex: He denies it!
