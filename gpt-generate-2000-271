T-Rex:  Hello, friend!  If you're starting a conversation with a voice, don't just listen to what he's saying; use that to convince him to stop!

Narrator:  SOON:
T-Rex:  I'm going to sell him some cookies!

Dromiceiomimus:  Hello, T-Rex!  You look a little upset!  How can I help you, T-Rex?
T-Rex:  Oh.  I'm sorry!  I didn't mean for that to make any sense.  It's just, believe me, you've got to be on my good side!

Utahraptor:  I believe you have to forgive him, my friend!
T-Rex:  What?  I forgive him, T-Rex!

Utahraptor:  I believe you can forgive someone for their actions, even if you don't actually mean it.
Utahraptor:  Well, I guess that doesn't matter if it's your LAST MORTAL REMEDIES, which is fine.  I forgive him anyway!  I forgive him anyway!

Narrator:  ENTHUSIASTS COMICS
Narrator:  WHEN DOES IT STOP?
