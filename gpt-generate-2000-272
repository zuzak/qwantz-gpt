T-Rex: One day, a group of teens decided that they liked each other and wanted to be friends with me SO MUCH that they agreed to actually be teens in the same relation as I do.
T-Rex: They signed up for an online course called "ICYMI"!

T-Rex: It's a bunch of stuff they named themselves.
T-Rex: "ICYMI: Make out, guys!!"
T-Rex: It was a bunch of stupid courses.

T-Rex: But we're signed up for the courses.  We'll talk and go on adventures and make out.  We'll call each other "weeping mammaries" and call ourselves "the smelly shoals of the internet".
T-Rex: Whoooo

Utahraptor: What are WEUP on smelly shoals??
T-Rex: Um... there's basically no reason to call us that.

T-Rex: "Is this the smelly best school ever??"  we'll say.
Utahraptor: The smelly best school is one which, come on, teens choose??
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: The smelly best school is one which, come on, teens choose??

T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: The smelly best school is one which, come on
T-Rex: The smelly best school
