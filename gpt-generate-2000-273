T-Rex: Man, I'm not buying one.  I've bought all my years of friendships and then maybe even more years of friendships and now I'm not buying one either!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Utahraptor, come quick, I'm bringing you back the Hallowe'en gift!

T-Rex: I'm bringing you back a Hallowe'en gift! Hooray!!
T-Rex: Now, you've probably already guessed what I'm sure will be a very pleasant surprise.  A very large Hallowe'en gift!
Dromiceiomimus: Is it a trick of the imagination?
T-Rex: No, it's just a special wooden slurry.

Utahraptor: T-Rex, I'm afraid that's impossible!  I don't imagine a trick of the imagination here.
T-Rex: Come on, tell me!

Utahraptor: Alright, well, I - 

T-Rex: I draw you a picture of a sleazy real-estate agent, talking to a woman whose name I don't know, and then holding the wrapped envelope up in his arms. 
Utahraptor: Huh?
T-Rex: It's funny, because he's talking to her.  I thought he was talking to the woman who filed the complaint with the police, because if he were I'd be flipping through her mail right now.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: So... I guess this is the magic number one gift?
T-Rex: You know... the one that, oh no, the police ignored?
