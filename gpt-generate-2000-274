T-Rex: I would like to have the ability to "see" my friends, and I'd like to have the ability to see them in action!  Here's my pitch!
T-Rex: I would like to have the ability to see my friends...

T-Rex: ...in action...in real time!

T-Rex: So, I'd like to see action!
T-Rex: First: I want to see what ACTUAL REAL-TIME friends are like.
T-Rex: Then: I want to see what, oh, enemy planes and enemy cars and enemy people and whatnot!
T-Rex: ACTION is what I'll be doing!

Utahraptor: T-Rex, is that you?
T-Rex: The guy who designed the "friend zone" for your enemy?

Utahraptor: Yep! It's a little thing called "friend zone" designating places where actual friends might be.
T-Rex: That's what I'm implying!

T-Rex: You're not supposed to have an "interview" with me.  That's not what I'm asking!
T-Rex: ...In some sort of action...
T-Rex: ...in real time!
