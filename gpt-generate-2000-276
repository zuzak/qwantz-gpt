T-Rex: I am a man who has put my career first by putting myself in the best possible smilin' hot Doc's hat, and by doing so, has put myself in the best company EVER IN THE HISTORY OF TIME.

T-Rex: Congratulations, people! On being inducted into the Rockwell Music Hall of Fame!

T-Rex: I have set out to change my life so that it might suit me best, and so that soon I might be living out my adult life on my way to becoming a rock star.
Dromiceiomimus: That's - that's a good course of action.
T-Rex: It is my only remaining professional endeavour.

T-Rex: I aim nevertheless to be the best rock star ever, which would make me the greatest rock star of all time.
Utahraptor: Which would mean... that implies... that implies better music?

T-Rex: No, great questions are worse than those involving lyrics and phrasings.
Utahraptor: I'm afraid I can't think of any.
T-Rex: Aw, good heavens!

T-Rex: Now I've decided not to be rock star rich!
