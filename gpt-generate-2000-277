T-Rex: I have felt the harsh sting of my own racial joke put to me.  Imagine if I told you today that I won the lottery?

T-Rex: You guys!

T-Rex: Well, imagine if, in a FEW HAND LATER, I told everyone in the audience that they had won the lottery, and that they had gone on to be productive men!
Dromiceiomimus: They didn't!
T-Rex: They did what you wish they'd to, Dromiceiomimus!

Utahraptor: You did what you wish they'd to, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Yeah, in a FEW HAND.

Utahraptor: Okay, fine.  I'm going to raise the ante.  I'm going to tell them I actually think the same thing.
T-Rex: Okay! Tell them it's true!
Utahraptor: Then we can go to the local grocery store and get some things!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: My grandfather was a store manager in the 60s!
Unnamed: I was never his grandfather!
T-Rex: Okay! Tell him it's true!
Unnamed: Anyway, I think it's time for me to clean out my house!
T-Rex: *sigh*
