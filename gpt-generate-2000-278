T-Rex: I have a friend who has a problem.  He's a big guy, but he looks like a baby!!

T-Rex: Is this the future?

T-Rex: No, I mean, not really.  I tried to come up with a way to deal with it, and it's like - what are you talking about?  I don't want to be the guy who gets angry at cartoons!  I could be the one who gets really angry at cartoons.  I don't want to be.
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe - maybe not?
T-Rex: Maybe not now!

Utahraptor: So let's hear your alternative: 50/50 mixed in with some of the rest of the population.
T-Rex: Yes!

T-Rex: And weighted by how poorly the rest of us fit together.  You know?  A 50/50 mixed in with some of the rest of the population is called a "mind-body", Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: I've never heard of that.
T-Rex: Okay, well, it's just -- people who do that sometimes.  It doesn't really count.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX IS MAKING CHANGES IN HIS LIFE:
T-Rex: <<quietly>> I'm pretty sure my life will be better in the new version I've just made available to me!
T-Rex: <<sigh>>
