T-Rex:  So I was working on a game where the good guys get mugged and have to mug someone EVERY NIGHT to survive!

T-Rex:  It would be so great, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus:  Hello!
T-Rex:  I'll take what I can get!!

Utahraptor:  You've already got mugged, T-Rex!
T-Rex:  Yeah, but I don't know ANY muggers who stand up in a dark room, trusting me with my freedom.

T-Rex:  Man, what if there was a secret mugging in Gotham instead?
Utahraptor:  The secret is that you're not a mugger, T-Rex.  I was simply enlarging the Gotham Gotham Gotham Batman self!
T-Rex:  Holy crap, this is just a heads up!  I'm going to make THIS dream a reality!!

T-Rex:  It's going to be BATMAN ADVENTURES, by Dromiceiomimus!
T-Rex:  The story takes place on a rooftop with a mysterious figure, dressed in a kangaroo suit and sporting a shark tail.  He's speaking in the voice of a man: "I declare, this realm is not worthy of our consideration."
T-Rex:  I'm putting my money where my mouth is; it doesn't belong to THAT man!
