T-Rex: There's a joke that says if you don't have a pen, then if the bird calls you a "bald-2 bird", then you might as well call it a day.

T-Rex: "A bird CALLED me a nickname!"

T-Rex: Well, that's ridiculous! I'm not saying calling an animal a nickname is the same as calling it a name. We're different animals and we have different internal states of language. I'm just saying we do when we're called that.
Dromiceiomimus: Well I'm not saying a joke is better than a good one.
T-Rex: You can still be funny if you don't rely on language to tell you jokes!

Utahraptor: Well I'm not saying a joke is better than a good one, T-Rex.
T-Rex: I'M NOT SURE WHAT. I'm just saying if you don't have a pen then you can call it a day.

Utahraptor: I can't be more certain!
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I'm calling Utahraptor a day.
Utahraptor: You can't be both!
T-Rex: Whatever, I'm sure we'll be laughing in the morning.

Narrator: AT THE WHISPER STOP:
Voice from outside the screen: T-Rex, do you have any more jokes to say?
T-Rex: Um, "My weight: 3000 gramas? T-Rex, I ate that. What to call someone??"
T-Rex: Oh my god, no!!
