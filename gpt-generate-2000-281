T-Rex:  I think I have sex addiction, but like, for food!

T-Rex:  I don't know WHY!

T-Rex:  It's  pretty much always  being horny that makes me sexy, you know?  And that's probably why I keep on being sexy for the rest of my life!  As soon as I get old, I either get into a stable income and/or a boat ride home, and then I figure, what, whatever, I don't care what anyone thinks I do?  And my life doesn't matter that I keep on being sexy!

Utahraptor:  And if so, how are you using your sexuality to your advantage?
T-Rex:  I'm experimenting with it!

T-Rex:  I'm not sure if it's making me sexy, but I'm TOTALLY experimenting.
Utahraptor:  "T-Rex", you're talking to me?  You're from the future, and you've ALREADY used your sexuality to your advantage.  That's pretty much the definition of sexy!

T-Rex:  I'm from the future, and I'm experimenting with it!
