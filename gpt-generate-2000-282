Narrator: "CREDIT CARD FRAUD"

T-Rex: Credit card fraud is a growing problem in today's society!

T-Rex: I believe the fault of this lies in the inherent design flaws of the credit card system.  If I give a credit card to someone, that should authorize one purchase, for a specific amount, at that specific time!  Instead, knowing someone's credit card information allows you to make charges to it for any amount, at any time, all over the world!

Utahraptor: This certainly is a lot of talk about credit cards!  Aren't there any more pressing issues, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Like what?

Utahraptor: Oh, like, I don't know... WORLD HUNGER?
T-Rex: But I don't understand it!  As my friend Robyn said, "There are always one or two solutions to a problem, and the best one is the best solution always the most cost-effective?"
Utahraptor: Really?  That's very mature, and I'm glad you like it.

T-Rex: I'm glad you like it too!  I'm glad you named it "Twitter Gravity."
T-Rex: WE'VE DISCUSSED IT
