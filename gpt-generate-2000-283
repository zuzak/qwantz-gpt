T-Rex: I'm not a guy who ruins mouthfuls of things. I'm not even that!

T-Rex: Oh.
T-Rex: It's not the SMALLEST thing.

T-Rex: But I'm not going to IGNORE the possibility that I've been there, something I could've done years ago! Maybe blow up some planets? Or maybe I could... ROCK STAR?!
T-Rex: Hey Dromiceiomimus, if you're gonna be a dude who ruins SMALL planets, why not get it started on some more moderately sized planets?
Dromiceiomimus: Teenagers?
T-Rex: Heck yes! ROCK STAR is the first planet where I could've formed a crew and I would've nicknamed it "The Booty".

Utahraptor: And now you're not a guy who ruins SMALL planets?
T-Rex: ROCK STAR is just the opposite!

T-Rex: If my parents -
T-Rex: - developed nappy nappy nappy nappy nappy on some more moderately sized planets, then maybe I could compete with them for teen girlfriends!!
Utahraptor: And maybe compete with them on other planets too.
T-Rex: EXACTLY.
Utahraptor: And maybe we could build robot suits that could take the place of the Earth-born robot suits we'd then wear when death do us in!

Narrator: SOON:

God: T-REX
God: ALSO
God: LISTEN
God: I CHECK IT OUT
