T-Rex: Man, everyone! You should see an ambulance coming! You should. It's a man!

T-Rex: It's a man coming out of a house full of criminals!

T-Rex: And he's blind and you can see well enough to make the medical effort ethical because that is charity, and I don't feel bad about that. I feel bad about the medical charity! I feel bad about the medical charity! I feel bad about the medical charity!

Utahraptor: Are you gonna run away from this family dispute?
T-Rex: I am!

T-Rex: I won the medical charity! The dispute is now settled!
Utahraptor: You're out! The medical charity is now settled!
T-Rex: I'm gonna run away too!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Well, whatever! I still feel bad about running away with this family member, but it's settled! I don't feel bad about running away with this family member! I feel bad about running away with this family member!
T-Rex: I feel bad about running away with this family member!
