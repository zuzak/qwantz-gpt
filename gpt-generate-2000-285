Narrator: HOW TO TRULY MAKE NEW FRIENDS
T-Rex: New friends are when you're suddenly introduced to ALL the new friends you've made through email and phone calls! They're like your extended family, except you have a new friend called "Your mom" though, so you take your new friend's Mom's name and wear 'erotic-sounding names' (which is weird because I've never felt this way about people named "Mom").

T-Rex: And those new friends are like "My God, our world is soendered!"

T-Rex: "It's just - we're just polluting it with stupid names that don't even make it to the end of the title!"
T-Rex: "We're losing our T-Rex sense of humour??"
T-Rex: "We're breaking up with our friends for real women, you guys?"

Utahraptor: New friends are the new sex, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Pretty crazy!

T-Rex: If you were a new friend who had just been made aware that "ironically" some "men were sleeping with women" thing had happened, I would be very interested in making you a new friend!
Utahraptor: I - 
T-Rex: I guess I have no interest in developing new friendships.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE FUTURE:
T-Rex: Oh my god, are you the kind of guy who just wants to be friends??
T-Rex: I am in need of a new science degree!
