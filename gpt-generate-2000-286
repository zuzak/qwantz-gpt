T-Rex: A metaphorical car chase is SAD for people who write in to take us out of their way for puns and erotica!

T-Rex: It's such an important part of what ails us all.

T-Rex: And yet, the best way to explore this is to just get in on the action! For example: Dromiceiomimus, who would anything be a regular person if he didn't have a car?
Dromiceiomimus: I - I don't really have a car?
T-Rex: Well, at least you can get away with that.

T-Rex: But Dromiceiomimus, you're not supposed to have a car. You're supposed to be discreet. And in my case, I'm the one having a car.
Utahraptor: Really? You're supposed to be discreet?

T-Rex: Yeah, really, but I'm not! I can't trust myself if I'm having a metaphorical car chase.
Utahraptor: Really?
T-Rex: Well, I suppose it's unfair that you can't trust yourself to not have cars.

T-Rex: But then I suppose it's fair for everyone else to be pretending not to have one??
