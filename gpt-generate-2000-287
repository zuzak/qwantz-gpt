T-Rex: I have the best idea for a Batman comic. It's a Batman comic about a Batman who exists in our world, the real world. But he doesn't know he's Batman yet. And when he comes to visit his friends, he tells them he's "in high supply" and promises to deliver the comic when their "needs get better". 

T-Rex: Am I writing a timeless work of literature? 

T-Rex: I'm pretty sure so, no doubt. 
T-Rex: Superman has a problem. Can we trust a character whose entire life has been covered by a magazine for bad press? Sure. But I think what I've got is a script. 
T-Rex: All I really want to do is write a story where Batman's (arguably) best friend Bruce "Screw It" McPhee (Nammo, Aspergers).

Utahraptor: So you want a Batman supporting character, but they're not really friends?
T-Rex: No, but that's what stories do!

T-Rex: I want a Batman that's not a regular Mr. DarcyChops and Mr. Scabbers. A Batman that's not even that wacky sometimes. A Batman that doesn't act like he's hiding under a tree by the handle. A Batman that acts like he's getting a text message from a Mrs. Doubs.
Utahraptor: A Batman that won't actually shoot lasers though.

Narrator: THE END
Narrator: PS: THERE. I STILL REALLY REALLY DO NOT WANT THAT
Narrator: PS I DIDN'T
Narrator: PS THE BUTTER
