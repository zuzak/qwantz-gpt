Narrator: HOW TO RUSH OUT TO SEA WITH SOME FRIENDS
T-Rex: You know how when you see someone on the street, you're like, "H/T T-Rex? Looks like it for some reason! I'm not supposed to come here!"

T-Rex: It's like - it's like if your mom found you at a fast food meal and found your mistake?

T-Rex: Like, all the time!

T-Rex: You're like, every time you want to pull yourself together you just have to show up! And when you don't, you lie and say, "I'm not allowed to!" and when you do, you cry! And at the end you get to look your friends in the face and say "Oh."
T-Rex: I'm not sure how to sum it up.

Utahraptor: So, how do you plan to move forward?
T-Rex: Eh?

Utahraptor: Well, assuming you're still friends with at least a little and you're not going to break up, then you're fine. But if you're not, I don't see how you're getting anything done.
T-Rex: Fine! I'm going to work on that now!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Well!
T-Rex: Hey, ask me what my opinions on mobile are and I'm gonna take care of all the talking!
