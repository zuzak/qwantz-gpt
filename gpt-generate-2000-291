T-Rex: Let us assume that the Earth is orbiting a red dwarf!

T-Rex: That's because the Earth is orbiting a whopping 27.7 billion kilometers, or 20.2 x 107 days! That's some friggin' sun!

T-Rex: That means, for every day that goes by that's 27.7 days are other days in the future when we're not 100% sure if days are a continuum. So, for example, if we're seven days from now and we're calculating the probability of a sunflower being in the room with us, that's another positive number that doesn't tell us the future. But we have DONE the past week to run with it. We are now TOTALLY DOZEN.

T-Rex: We then head into a world where the future is totally friggin' awesome.
Utahraptor: So it's a cosmic grey day for all future flowers?

T-Rex: Yes, a world where every day is a beautiful day for FLOWER.  Yes. This is the future.  And the flowers there bloom incredibly well, and we, as a species, cannot know when to call them.
Utahraptor: That's the future.  Here comes the future, T-Rex!  This is the future!!

T-Rex: In the intervening period - IN THE FUTURE:
T-Rex: A lady with a tan undertone?
T-Rex: I'm sorry, T-Rex, but you're misunderstanding the question.  When did you think you were?
T-Rex: Well, um...
T-Rex: five years?
