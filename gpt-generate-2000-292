T-Rex: Scientists have long known that our deepest secrets can be mapped onto atoms in size and who we're really talking about. But a team of scientists led by Nobel Prize winner and others has finally revealed the secret:

T-Rex: WE'RE NOT EVEN GETTING THAT FAR

T-Rex: The secret: atoms don't need to be massed! Rather, everything that moves - EVERYTHING CONVERTES IN - AND SUSTAINES IN - is massed. And that means "past" or "present" is actually a relative word, since it means "within, now present"! Basically, our universe is a BEAUTIFUL place.
Dromiceiomimus: So make it "past" and "future"!
T-Rex: I already know that's what they mean!

Utahraptor: Well, maybe "past" is a verb, not a noun!
T-Rex: Oh!

T-Rex: Or maybe "past" is just a meta- verb that drops itself when you try to add an exclamation to it. "Future" is more of a generic intensifier, and verbs still have this thing going.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, this is terrible.
T-Rex: Let's adopt our universe's hunched fists and policies of amplification and deconstruction as our guide instead!!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX IS GOING TO LEARN MORE:
T-Rex: BECAUSE I'VE GOT A FULL LEGENDS
T-Rex: HAH HAH HAH
T-Rex: AWESOME
