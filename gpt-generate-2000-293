T-Rex:  Hello, friend!  I have some questions for you!
T-Rex:  For your information, I have discovered the secret sauce of social doubt!

T-Rex:  If I were to ask the other person what they think about same-sex marriage, the other person would say "I really think that, yes, it's so far-fetched that I should lightly mention it.  I'm not sure that there isn't an easy-to-understand social construction called 'utopia'."
T-Rex:  "OK!  Here's the secret sauce:  WE CAN HAVE FURTHER THAN JUST THOSE TICKING RATE OF MARRIAGE."

Utahraptor:  T-Rex, I totally just discovered the secret sauce of social doubt!
T-Rex:  No, wait - don't stop.  We can have it, friend!  We can have it.
T-Rex:  YES.  We can have it!

T-Rex:  So!  One time I went as a date/upcoming date-thwift and got beat up!
Utahraptor:  Turn around!
T-Rex:  Turn around!
T-Rex:  THAT'S it!  See how I'm the most hated person in the world?  AND, FINALLY, how everything was always like this...
