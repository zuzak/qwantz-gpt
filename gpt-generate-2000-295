T-Rex: I've written a draft of a new book!  But wait they say I can't make it?

T-Rex: IT'S JUST ONE BOOK.

T-Rex: The other book is this awesome alternate-universe where T-Rex's driving a truck full of cars and one of the cars gets hit by a truck!
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, do you ever think about how we could all get along just fine without conflict?
T-Rex: It's real interesting! I never thought I'd ever write something about my life (aside from the occasional line in the story, of course) but I've got this awesome tension whenever I think about it.

Utahraptor: I really don't think conflict is a dealbreaker!
T-Rex: See, I totally do!

T-Rex: I'd have to think of something to resolve conflicts with, like - alcohol?        snacks?       games?       games where you win!     I don't know.     I guess I don't have the "deal" with this?
T-Rex: Utahraptor, you're the one with the charm!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: So I'm driving through downtown, and I see three cars pile up!
Utahraptor: Hah hah! Ouch!
T-Rex: HECK YES I DO HAVE THE TRICK
