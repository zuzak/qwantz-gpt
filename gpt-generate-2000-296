T-Rex: You know what I'm sayin', you know what I'm sayin'?

T-Rex: People say things like "You can't live without water", "The season is almost over", or "Get out of bed". But there's really not much to say about what they're saying!

T-Rex: So I've decided to start recording my own personal life style! Rather than telling everyone who's saying anything interesting, I've decided to say what I'm saying right now!
Dromiceiomimus: What?
T-Rex: Right now I'm just sayin'!

Utahraptor: So, say what you want about Windows Phone 8, but it's just a regular Windows Phone 8 thing!
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: Windows Phone 8 has been solid. I'm sayin' it now!
Utahraptor: Well, it's happening eventually.
T-Rex: Maybe in the first quarter of this year.

Narrator: THOSE ARE THE SAME THINGS T-REX SAYS.
Narrator: IT'S LATE BUT.
Narrator: IT'S LATE BUT. YOU ARE DOING BETTER THAN YOU EVER WERE.
