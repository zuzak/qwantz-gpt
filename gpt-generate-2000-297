T-Rex:  Hello, friend!  In this dream, I am a lone wolf, roaming the wilderness!

T-Rex:  But not anymore!  I'm your ghost, T-Rex, and you will be gone when I reach 10 years old.

T-Rex:  Your ghost will stare at me, as though we're living in an alternate reality, with you in a body that can last for thousands of years.  I will consume the flesh of those I encounter, and you will live on as a ghost.  I will eat my own flesh.  I will make you my friend.

T-Rex:  I do not wish to become the ghost I know.  I wish to find out what it is like to be an adult.  I do not wish to become a ghost and make you my friend.  I do not wish to become 100% owned and make you my friend.  I do not wish to become 100% ghost and make you my friend.

T-Rex:  I wish to become fully owned and make you 100% ghost, please RT.
Utahraptor:  I wish to become fully ghost and make you wish to eat as many ice cream sandwiches as I can, please RT!

T-Rex:  I do not wish to become and buy the very last book I can get my hands on, please RT!
Utahraptor:  I wish to become completely self-taught and eat as many chips as I can, please RT!
