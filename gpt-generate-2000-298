T-Rex:  As my body ages, so do I.  As my interests and interests have developed, so do I in the ways of fiction!

T-Rex:  First it was me sitting around telling people what to believe, and watching people get SO PISSED that they barely even noticed I was writing about aging!

T-Rex:  Then, OH NO.  As my writing techniques get better, so do I in my outrageous and sometimes impossible-to-remember self-portraits!
Dromiceiomimus:  No, T-Rex, as a secret to being kept alive, you mustn't be a fan of my constant references to "artificial" aging!
T-Rex:  Man, I hate artificial aging!

Utahraptor:  I think we're in for a story where as T-Rex, you begin to doubt the very immortality and worthiness of our most basic needs, the thought of not having any of them at all!
T-Rex:  Oh yeah?
T-Rex:  SERVING FLESHMANCE IN A FLAVOURIZING TORE COCHE

Narrator:  LATER:
T-Rex:  My greatest fear has finally come true, as I soak the well-flowing wetland with my favourite wetland grea
T-Rex:  My greatest fear has finally come true as I begin to wonder if I'm truly as amazing as the water heater I have
