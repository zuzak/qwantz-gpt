T-Rex: A Story about a Man who Decided To Become...

T-Rex: A Dinosaur!

T-Rex: He decided to become a dinosaur because he liked it, he said, and decided to put all his heart and soul into evolving from a smaller animal into a more sublime and more transcendental being.  He decided to become one with the simple pleasure of eating things!
Dromiceiomimus: Dinosaur, you should not have gotten that far, baby.
T-Rex: What?  I thought I was gonna be a dinosaur, Dromiceiomimus!

Utahraptor: You think you can become a dinosaur by simply applying some simple animal-based dietitian principles?
T-Rex: I thought I was going to become a dinosaur, my friend!

T-Rex: Besides, I didn't just decide to become a dinosaur by simply applying simple animal-based principles.  I also decided to become a dinosaur by learning how to control his internal state.
Utahraptor: That's a pretty badass name.
T-Rex: It must be so badass!

T-Rex: And so when I finally learn to control my internal state, the dinosaur is...
T-Rex: ... oh no!
T-Rex: I feel as though I've been sent through the pokiness hole of being turned into a bird!
