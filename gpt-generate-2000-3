T-Rex:  I have come up with the ultimate foolproof way to be totally invisible!  And I will call it, "The invisible hand!"

T-Rex:  In a word, " unbeatable!"

T-Rex:  So here's the secret:  if I'm not invisible, things happen to me!
T-Rex:  Things happen to me when I'm not invisible!
T-Rex:  Things can happen to me when I'm not invisible!

Utahraptor:  Isn't that a bit expensive?
T-Rex:  Boo!

T-Rex:  But if I get super invisible a hand, then my last words will be "T-Rex, I'm invisible!  You see me with all the naked eye!  You see what you think I think I see."
Utahraptor:  Sounds expensive!
T-Rex:  I can't think of anything that would be more fun!

Narrator:  LATER:
T-Rex:  Utahraptor, my voice is getting pretty loud.  I'm trying to enter the bedroom.
Utahraptor:  Then get in the bedroom as a pet.
T-Rex:  Yes, I believe this will be called "Pet Novena!"
