T-Rex: So after losing all my sense of smell, I came out of it feeling even MORE ALIVE THAN EVER BEFORE. Somehow, my sense of taste and hearing were unaffected! Somehow, I could feel the cold in my hand. Somehow.

T-Rex: Somehow!

T-Rex: Somehow!
T-Rex: Somehow!
T-Rex: Somehow!
T-Rex: Somehow!
T-Rex: Somehow!
T-Rex: Somehow!

Utahraptor: So what happened then?
T-Rex: It was a really interesting development!

T-Rex: The whole thing began...
T-Rex: ... with a letter I got while talking with a lady at a restaurant called Bistro Superb!
T-Rex: The lady told me that one time a man broke into her house while she was out doing her reading of the dictionary!
T-Rex: Oh my goodness!
T-Rex: That letter certainly made my day!
