T-Rex: "The world is a finite place. Laws can be invented to limit the universe to mineable parts, but such laws can never be invented. Laws can forever be in conflict with the very fabric of the universe itself!"

T-Rex: Proud people!

T-Rex: Laws are the art of changing behaviour! In the universe of atoms, laws can be more 'in charge' than in an 'office'. Law-abiding people can practise their law while dying.
Dromiceiomimus: But you'd be a law-breaker, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Huh?

Utahraptor: In the universe of atoms, laws can be 'upped' in some cases!
T-Rex: That's not really true, nor is it really helpful. Laws can be 'upped' in a variety of ways. For instance, some people use law as a way to minimize their liability in conflicts of interest laws.

T-Rex: Well, I get that the universe is finite, but isn't that right? And um, some people use law as a way to get by in governance their money?
Utahraptor: Right.
T-Rex: And that's something!

Narrator: SOON.
T-Rex: Utahraptor, you know what? I bet we could use our comedic talents to do some serious "funny news" for Business!
T-Rex: I actually think we could use that instead.
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: ...In an "In-Clerical" capacity.
