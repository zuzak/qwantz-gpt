T-Rex: cracking the code is easy!

T-Rex: it's just drop by drop we went through doing it for years and years and ended up doing it all by doing it for yourself

T-Rex: I'm serious! If I'm cracking the code of a programming language then why shouldn't I be doing it myself? Why would I?
Dromiceiomimus: Come on T-Rex, it's your turn right now.
T-Rex: BUT FINALLY!! Let's crack the code of the programming language!

Utahraptor: Okay, so what parts of it are you going to crack, and when?
T-Rex: I'm going to crack the first public version of the programming language!

T-Rex: I'll be ultra verbose and explain in greater detail why the first version is way way way way way way WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY way way way way way way way way way way".

T-Rex: We are now free men and ready to crack the code of the programming language!!
Utahraptor: We are ready to crack the code of the programming language!!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: We are ready to crack the code of the programming language!!
