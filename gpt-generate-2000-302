T-Rex: Hello!  I have some very personal reasons for this.  Anyway, who knows so much??

T-Rex: It GIVES ME A COMPELLING TATTOO

Dromiceiomimus: "How old am I?"
T-Rex: Dudes know what you're thinking!
Dromiceiomimus: I'm thinking maybe I'm really T-Rex, or maybe I'm just a different generation, maybe I'm this more modern and out of sorts.  Whatever. All I'm saying is this: if I had a magic circle, I would invite Dromiceiomimicon to my house!

Utahraptor: I don't think anyone would want to invite you!
T-Rex: What?  Of course not!

Utahraptor: Sure they would!  My house is like a mini-Orbital Chamber, with a very high proportion of people in the upper classes (seriously, Dromiceiomimus) and a very low proportion of people in the lower classes (seriously, T-Rex)!
T-Rex: Um.  Well, maybe they wouldn't actually be able to afford it?

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary!  You know what I mean?  I ran out of money and now I have no money to spend on anything.
T-Rex: Also, I now realize that I was just being nice.
T-Rex: (That's okay, that's not a problem!)
