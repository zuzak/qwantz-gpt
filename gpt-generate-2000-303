T-Rex: I am a guy who has a lot of issues with self-doubt.

T-Rex: I'm afraid that today is the day I give up on being a dinosaur and get into a car!

T-Rex: For starters, I'll probably give up on that dream.  Self-doubt is the tendency of people to think things are pretty, or pretty, or pretty much whatever they think they are, on a level playing field.  Doubtful people will try to hit on you, and if you counter their chances, you'll just be tripping on stuff you didn't even know you had!

Utahraptor: But you've got this tendency to these crazy mental illnesses, where you think things could be cured, but you don't!
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: Here's a great way to feel confident without worrying about your mental illness: I'm cool with that. I'm cool with eating the same sammich as I normally do, or skydiving; I don't know. I'm cool with eating chips from a distance because they're delicious when I'm not staring! I'm cool with eating out loud because it's probably not going to get anyone anything else they'll say. 

Narrator: BUT IT'S NOT WORTH IT:
T-Rex: You know what? I'll probably be wrong, and that sucks, but I'm going to get through life believing I'll get what I want! I'm going to believe it when I look back on it, when I finally realize what I was always going to want. I'm going to believe there's nothing left for me to do now that I was going to learn something new!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: Attention, world!
