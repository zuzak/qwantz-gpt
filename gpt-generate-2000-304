T-Rex: You've probably heard of my friend, right?  But I'd like to:

T-Rex: Learn more about him and his life!

T-Rex: He became my #1 HERITAGE and best friend ever!  He's like my adult adult who loves me and she wants me to do things for her like in a tank but I'm like, dude, learn how to train THAT way.  How do you train that way??
Dromiceiomimus: He's your self-taught adult who likes to train Selfish Manliness.
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus.  How do you train that?

Dromiceiomimus: I train MANY different Selfish Manly Skills.  I call them "Manly Supremacy".
T-Rex: Excellent!  I've got a confession to make!

Utahraptor: You're thinking of a Manly Supremacy story, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Sure!

Utahraptor: In fact, I'm already inventing the genre!  My new story will be about... ME?
T-Rex: Um, ME?
Utahraptor: HOW ABOUT NOW?

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Excuse me!  I- I forgot my phone number!!
T-Rex: ...it's Richard Branson?
