T-Rex: I just found out that a woman has a degree! I was LUCKY TO KNOW THE CORE OUTPUT, but now that she's a bachelor has degrees, I can totally be happy.

T-Rex: Bachelorhood, you know? The idea that people can get degrees in exchange for money.

T-Rex: It's not that great, you guys! The idea that people can't hedge their bets is just not appealing. You can't expect people to invest their money well and invest their time appropriately toward the end.
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, there are definitely times when you're right!
T-Rex: I'm right!

Utahraptor: But what about the emotional tolls a good job can take?
T-Rex: There are! The number-crunching, interpersonal conflict resolution, and punishment workcales are tears of joy, and the number-one thing people should do with all the degrees is talk about!

Utahraptor: Wow, I'm glad we can work these things out.
T-Rex: Really?
T-Rex: Oh, really?!
