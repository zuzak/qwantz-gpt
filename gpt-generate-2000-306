T-Rex: I think it would be a great idea to write a maxims treatise on all language!

T-Rex: All the essential maxims 

T-Rex: on one hand, all the standard maxims

T-Rex: On the other hand, I don't think it's going to be easy

T-Rex: We've got a language impediment that tries to get around our limited senses! And it's trying really hard to get around those limits, and so far it's succeeded! All the standard maxims are there, and the problem of perspective is solved!

Utahraptor: But there's also the problem of semantics, which is a problem that we can only solve by re-using existing language!

T-Rex: That's true!

T-Rex: But new maxims can be developed in a very limited and difficult way!
Utahraptor: A Nobel Prize!

T-Rex: So I propose a concept for solving these two problems. It's as old as language itself: we've got a language (synthetic) that gets updated with semantics, and semantics gets to update as needed.
T-Rex: So it's a situation where the updates are in the form of more recent versions?
