T-Rex: I had the strangest dream last night...

T-Rex: A crazy man appeared before a series of doors, one leading to each den!

T-Rex: He entered the house slowly, looking for any contraband he could see.  "I'm a Dromiceiomimus," he said.  "And here we are," he said, "in this house we share a bed, for we both share a bed."

Utahraptor: And then?
T-Rex: And then a door closed!

T-Rex: He tried to return the next morning, but when he arrived he was instead confronted by a strange man wearing a magic ring.  He demanded his freedom.
Utahraptor: "We have to go."
T-Rex: He replied.

T-Rex: "We both agreed we would go," the man said.  He took T-Rex's hand and moved them both towards the bed.
Utahraptor: T-Rex... DON'T TELL THE TEENS NOT HAVE BED YET!!
T-Rex: I'll... NOT TELL THE TEENS NOT WANT TO TUNE IN FOR THE SUDDEN SHOW!!

T-Rex: As he moved towards the teens, one pulled themselves together and in thOUGH TRANSLATION, they said "YES" without even realizing it.  
T-Rex: AWESOME
