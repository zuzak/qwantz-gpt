T-Rex: Okay I finally did it. I wrote all of my bestselling fictions on ice. And now I'm chillin' in winter, without the constant threat of winter's hail and the constant need to rap outside my friggin' houses!

T-Rex: My stars are clearly now clearly defined by the ice.

T-Rex: It has increasingly come down to luck on ice, Dromiceiomimus! If I'm to really have to rap, I'll have to chill at something! And that means I can rap outside my door, because that's -
Dromiceiomimus: - that's chillin' in winter!
T-Rex: - that's also chillin' in winter.

T-Rex: I'm rapin' outside my house, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: Yes?

T-Rex: Yes, I'm gonna rap outside my house!
Utahraptor: Where?
T-Rex: Outside my house!
Utahraptor: It's uh, it's North Pole?
T-Rex: Oh God, that's terrible!! Nobody said anything, but I feel like I've heard some very compelling things about rap outside of my door.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN A DYSTOPIAN FAIRY ARELAND!
T-Rex: Dear innocent!
T-Rex: If you're so inclined, I'd really like to go flyin' out to the North Pole in a "vacation kit"
