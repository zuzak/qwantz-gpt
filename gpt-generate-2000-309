T-Rex: My favourite novel was, without a doubt, one with a back-story like, Pride and Prejudice?

T-Rex: Hah hah hah! What a ridiculous premise, if true, that is!

T-Rex: So the party takes place on a planet where everyone knows everyone else's opinions and is effectively submissive!
Dromiceiomimus: Isn't it also a story of interpersonal conflict, where the only option is love?
T-Rex: It is!

T-Rex: It's great!  Everyone knows their own personal opinions, but everyone can talk to each other!  SEXY PEOPLE ARE STILL MAKING SPECIFIC ANSWERS TO THOSE RULES.
Utahraptor: It's a good story about the challenges and seedy side of life?

T-Rex: It's a very good book, if you are into sexual politics!
T-Rex: As with most things, it is a portrait of the compromises women make, sometimes literally!
T-Rex: For example, one woman was having second thoughts while she was having sex with a man.  And when she broached it she said "For what?  To have second thoughts?  I don't know; these are the thoughts that come to me."

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE THE DUDE WHO CREATED THE UNIVERSE HAS TOLD HER HE THING.

T-Rex: HE ALSO SAYS THAT HE WAS TERRIFIED AFTER WRITING IT.
T-Rex: "I think it's fair," he said.
T-Rex: "I think it's something for dinner!  I'll probably write the sentences on the chalkboard," said the other man.
T-Rex: "See?  I wrote the sentences on the chalkboard?  Whoah.  Wow.  Really wrote the sentences on the chalkboard?  Wow.  Really?  Did that work?  Let me know!  I'll call the cops."

{{Title text: the cop said "Wow.  Really wrote the sentences on the chalkboard?  Wow.  Really wrote the sentences on the chalkboard?  Wow.  Wow.  Wow}}
