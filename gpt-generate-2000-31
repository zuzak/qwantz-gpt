T-Rex: Okay, so - I'm going to say this as honestly as possible, and here's the thing - I've had really nice relations with women lately.

T-Rex: They are, actually!

T-Rex: They have become more like me!  More like Dromiceiomimus, who wants more out of her time spent with men, and who, thanks to my friendship with Dromiceio...
Dromiceiomimus: ...Turned down my offer of dates?
T-Rex: Turned down her offer of drinks?  Nice try, Domiceiomimus!  You've shown no sign of abating since I showed you my new relationship drama series!

Utahraptor: Good morning, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Rise, my friend!  Let's break up first!

Utahraptor: This is a very important first note: what's up with you?
T-Rex: Oh my god, what am I saying?
Utahraptor: You should... kiss her more often?

T-Rex: Yes, please!
T-Rex: Let's... explore... our shared interest in one more time?
