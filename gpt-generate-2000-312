T-Rex: Do you like movies where there is a metaphor for a universe shrinking back to reveal the face of the universe, but all is not lost? Or maybe you just like pop culture where one awesome person narrates the most memorable moment?

T-Rex: Either way, let's share a moment of music!

T-Rex: Do you like music that is simultaneously nostalgic for a time when you were not, and also a metaphor for a place where you could probably be if you had lived there longer?
Dromiceiomimus: Um... Do you like music that's simultaneously nostalgic and a reminder of how we, as a people, have turned the past into the future?
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus yes!

Utahraptor: Yeah, but you can never go back!
T-Rex: True!

T-Rex: But I can never go back. It's like - all I can do is sit back and enjoy the music. I don't know what else I can do?
Utahraptor: Or you can sit back, relax and enjoy the music!

Narrator: MEANWHILE IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX IS DYING:
T-Rex: I'm gonna be honest: I don't know what else I can do!
