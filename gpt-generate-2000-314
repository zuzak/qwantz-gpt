T-Rex:  You are likely sitting there in an office chair, staring at an endless series of interconnected computer monitors, staring at a constantly-changing set of displayed email.  Are these the eternal monitors?  Maybe they are just a regular window on the surface of the medium that can be adjusted by hand, allowing you to be constantly updated through out life!  Maybe you are living every day like a child.  If that is the case then you are probably doing something wrong.  Maybe that is not.  

T-Rex:  That's why I feel YOUNG.
T-Rex:  - Your opinions and revelations will be welcomed!!

T-Rex:  Anyway, as you know I have been a regular customer for the past 3 years
Utahraptor: What are you doing here, T-Rex?

T-Rex:  Oh sorry Utahraptor, but YES my opinions and revelations will be welcomed!!

T-Rex:  And YES by "appliances" I mean getting regular mail too, maybe a regular front page with some friggin' cute Batman skin on top!
Utahraptor: But what about Batman's backup plan, which he uses to GET back the favor?
T-Rex: Aw man!  The government has their own secret front page, rules and laws and everything!!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: WHAT IF Batman had his gun and backup came back?
T-Rex:  I wonder... if the gun went off in the middle of the fight?
