T-Rex: In my spare time I'm going to travel the world, and with your help I can send a message to everyone!

T-Rex: Everybody knows this message is sent to the CULTIVATE INFERIOR CHANGES, but nobody cares because they all continue to live happily ever after!

T-Rex: It's a utopia, Dromiceiomimus! The world is better for everyone doing jobs that matter, and the only job that doesn't is on the world stage.
Dromiceiomimus: So your message isn't heard over town or on the news.
T-Rex: But MY message isn't ignored! I'm going to go where the winds and circumpolar music won't. OrANGE PLEASURE TASTE, HUH?
HUH!

Utahraptor: HOW TOTALLY CAN'T YOU TELL A CONVERSATION STOP BLAMING EVERY second?
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: So my message is, WITHOUT FEAR, sent to EVERY culture on the planet. And it's a message that's universal, since all the music people listen to on a daily basis is an universal universal universal thing to listen to. And the best way to send that universal thing is to SEA IT ALL DOWN THE STAIRS.
Utahraptor: So why are you going to town on us?

T-Rex: Dude, it's Earth! And YOU, my friend, you're not going to town.
Utahraptor: You're staying put?
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: And if the winds don't blow us somewhere soon, then you're staying put at sea level, and that's a marine mammal! The only way to send a message isn't to sea level, but to send a message.
T-Rex: You know how the GOVERN can be so interessting?
