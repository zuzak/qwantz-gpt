T-Rex: I had the strangest dream last night...

T-Rex: It was as if someone had pushed past on top of my bed a beautiful young woman with a charming smile!
T-Rex: I don't remember what; I can only assume I was dreaming about someone else!

T-Rex: I presume my dream was one about her?
Utahraptor: Who?

T-Rex: Utahraptor, come on! It's me again!
Utahraptor: Oh no!

T-Rex: I can't assume that someone can push through on top of you!
