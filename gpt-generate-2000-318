T-Rex: So, a) We are born DEFINITELY with enough awesomeness in us for this to be a truly awesome life b) Let's just assume the expectation is borne of some higher quality than those brought about by societal conditioning, and hey presto, you're a cool adult!!

T-Rex: It's the magical 80s, everyone!!

T-Rex: So you've got this magical 80s feeling of being rejected and left outside, with your own problems and preconceptions completely at your mercy. I'm serious, you're a cool adult.
Dromiceiomimus: But then what happens?
T-Rex: Then you grow up into a totally cool adult again, this cooler than most, and by that I mean, more cool than you'd expect. And you realize that nobody cares you've got this, nobody to talk to about anything, and after like, YEARS you get the same messages as you! It's total baloney.

Utahraptor: I think the message is this: adults don't matter.
T-Rex: It is! Adults don't matter ANYMORE!

T-Rex: Adults don't care who you hang around with because if they don't, nobody's going to care what you think you're doing!
Utahraptor: Adults do matter, man! Adults WANT to be loved.
T-Rex: Adults ARE in charge of that, ladies.

T-Rex: They are the adults, and they're the adults WANT TO BE loved for. They want to be loved like nobody else is ever going to care about the feelings of someone else!
T-Rex: FINE.
