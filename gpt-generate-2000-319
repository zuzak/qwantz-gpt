Narrator: THINGS HERSELF ISN'T AVAILABLE IN T-REX'S STORY
T-Rex: Not actually!

T-Rex: What's a T-Rex: a person who gets opinions?

T-Rex: A person who can disagree with each other?
T-Rex: A T-Rex!  I am going to invent my own adjective for this!  "TREXIST"!

Utahraptor: You're going to make him feel good?
T-Rex: You are!  I will elevate him above petty petty-but-not-really-good-by dwellers!

T-Rex: I will make him laugh in the face of my standards!  I will make him wish he had invented all hip hop.  I will make him wish he had thrown all his pounds into a bear pen and said "Finally, this sucky sucks!"
Utahraptor: Really!  Really.  You wish you had thrown all your pounds into a bear pen and then you're the happiest person ever and you're the smartest dude!  A T-Rexist!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!
T-Rex: Shakespeare!  What do you do?
Shakespeare: I'M T-Rex!  Here is a question for you: what do you do when confronted with thousands of pounds of junk?
T-Rex: I'm the happiest dude!
