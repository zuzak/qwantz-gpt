T-Rex: I have in mind something that is almost TOO amazing!  A book that is almost indistinguishable from a regular book, if printed on solid gold!

T-Rex: Something so amazing it's amazing even I own it!

T-Rex: So what's the deal here?  A "books"?  A "books" canon?
T-Rex: What if I had the same thing happen to me?
T-Rex: In some cases...

Utahraptor: All these "books" that are almost indistinguishable from books are actually the same ones!
T-Rex: So true!

T-Rex: Okay, so the odds of these different "books" being the same book are about 1 in 5000,000,000.  That's about one in ten trillion, or about one in four trillion murders.  That's about one in six murders worldwide.
Utahraptor: That's just one dude I've never kissed!
T-Rex: That's just one dude I've never murdered!

Narrator: LATER, T-REX IS KISSING:
T-Rex: Guys, it's true!  I've actually kissed him once!
T-Rex: I'm actually almost certain I'll never meet someone like him again, since I've really only met socially as a married man.
