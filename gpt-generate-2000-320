T-Rex: Ghost parents!  They're talking to their kids all spooky!

T-Rex: I'm telling you, it's not scary!  It's PRETTY TERRIBLE.

T-Rex: It's why spooky houses can be SO NORMALLY EXCRUCIBLE.  Ghosts haunt spooky spookily!  In fact, I'm almost certain I'll go as far to say that spooky houses are the BEST HALLOWE'EN THING.  IT'S SUCH A MASTERY.
T-Rex: Plus, I can't tell if I've accidentally or not told the ghost parents what I'm thinking right now.  They're all saying "no" and then the ghost parents snap back a few seconds later, while counting to ten.  It's truly frightening!

Utahraptor: But what about the ghosts of parents who didn't kill their kids?
T-Rex:  Yeah, in the same way spooky spooky houses are.

T-Rex: Spooky spooky spooky.  It's like they're whispering in my ear, that this is all a dream until the ghost parents finally do something actually scary, and then the ghosts of the parents wake up and say "ohh good ;D"
Utahraptor: T-Rex, I really wish you wouldn't leave.
T-Rex: You know :).

T-Rex: I left you this card, but:  ultra creepy ghost spooky dad: ultra creepy ghost spooky!  You wake up in bed and whisper "I'm going to be a spooky spooky mummy for you" all over your shoulder!
T-Rex: :(
