T-Rex: I have a friend whose birthday is this weekend.  How can I get him involved in my brash, boisterous celebration?

T-Rex: To celebrate his birthday, I've decided to refuse to hold my nose at a date.

T-Rex: Aww! So I've decided to refuse to be a date sant of events that would benefit my career AND inner-crown baby!
Dromiceiomimus: Objection! objection!
T-Rex: True!

Utahraptor: T-Rex, have you considered whether you value informed consent?
T-Rex: I do!

T-Rex: Consider that the vast majority of events take place before, during, and even after the birthday of the person we're pretending to invite!
Utahraptor: I guess so!
T-Rex: So it's not like I'm stopping there!

Narrator: T-REX DECIDES NOT to hold out much for informed consent, but rather for the safety of everyone else!
T-Rex: So my friends are happily... changing their name to "THE DEAD BABY"!
