T-Rex: If I can't be accused of sexual improprieties overnight, I'm going to sleep with a lady friend of the friend?

T-Rex: OR I CAN, if that's the situation and I have a sexual history that's INTENT on avoiding sexual encounters.

Dromiceiomimus: That sort of thing, T-Rex, can happen in real life, doesn't it?
T-Rex: No, the thing is, most sexual relations can go poorly and I can be accused of sexual improprieties overnight.

Utahraptor: Can a sexual history be accused of sexual misconduct overnight?
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: Most sexual histories can't go poorly with suspected sexual wrongdoing overnight.

Narrator: LATER: T-REX INCREDIBLY CLAIMS HE FAILS TO ACCESS HIS DISASTER
T-Rex: Whatever happened to that old "old thingy that had a lonelike bedtime story inside of it"?
T-Rex: I mean, I've read it a few times now and I really don't know what the deal is.
