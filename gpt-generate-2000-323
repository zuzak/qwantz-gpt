T-Rex: I have received complaints. Apparently I can be difficult to follow, and sometimes people get confused.
T-Rex: I will endeavour to be as followable as possible!

T-Rex: Be as consistent!

T-Rex: Complaints should be directed to the complaints page for "Approximations of punctuation".

T-Rex: The "complaints" section should be filled out by the person directly sending the complaint to the complaint form.

Utahraptor: I believe this is correct?
T-Rex: Excellent!!

T-Rex: The form should also be filled out by the person receiving the complaint from whom the complaint was received.
Utahraptor: Perhaps I will just fill out a separate form.
T-Rex: Done.

Narrator: LATER: A NEW FORM FOR MEN
T-Rex: Dear Men!
T-Rex: It is time for me to DEFINITELY create my absolute fiercest enemy yet!
