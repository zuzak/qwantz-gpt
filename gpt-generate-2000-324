T-Rex: I have recently acquired some tasty treats from a distant and juicier end.  I will, in a manner of thought, call them, appropriately, "The Power to Punish".

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus!

Dromiceiomimus: Well, in that case, I encourage you to... not keep puking?
T-Rex: No, I'm not Punished!
Dromiceiomimus: True! Thank you!

Utahraptor: Wait - what are you saying, cutting and quivering?
T-Rex: No, I'm Sucker!!

T-Rex: I'm Punished!!
Utahraptor: Hah hah hah! "Sucker"?!
T-Rex: Hah hah, also HECK

T-Rex: ALSO YOU GOT ON THE FIRST
