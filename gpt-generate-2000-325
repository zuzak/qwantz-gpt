T-Rex: I'm going to write a spooky story, and it will be terrifying TERRIBLE, for it is against the law to ride a rollercoaster at night.

T-Rex: I'll start by telling you a story, for no stories are truly stories!

T-Rex: And then I'll tell you a terrifying story about a ghost, for that is the true story of how an ordinary person awoke to the horror of rollercoaster rides. And then we'll go on a haunted ride, and terrified everyone because it was inside our house, right?
T-Rex: Because it was.
T-Rex: Because inside.  We were terrified.

Utahraptor: I really don't see how this story can possibly be used as a basis for a spooky story!
T-Rex: You're right!

T-Rex: Instead of treating it like a crime, I'll Use It To Convince People That Ghosts Aren't Real, And Making Them Pay Attention In Social Habits!
Utahraptor: Sounds like a first course in hard science class!
T-Rex: Yes, as I believe it to be the best course.

T-Rex: I call my tale, "The Power of a Lotion"!
