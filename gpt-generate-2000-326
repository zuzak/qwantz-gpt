T-Rex: I think I have sex addiction, but like, for food!

T-Rex: Oh my gosh OH MY GOSH!

T-Rex: I can hardly eat any food right now - it's like - a bowl of spaghetti? What the hell, no small. But food addiction is when you're dependent on it being consumed, which means you're totally dependent on it and you can only eat so much.
T-Rex: /This is a disaster.'
T-Rex: it's terrible!!

Utahraptor: You're saying you have sex addiction?
T-Rex: Nope!

T-Rex: I'm fine. I'm fine. All I need to do is eat SO MANY WATER.
Utahraptor: That's a good thing.
T-Rex: Yes. But I'm not saying that's why you have it.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex (thought bubble): Sex addiction, if i eat so many foods at once and they're SO MANY DECOMPOSED...
T-Rex (thought bubble): Utahraptor, it's terrible
