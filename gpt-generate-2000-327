T-Rex: I am a geneticist who is big into genetic testing!  It's been my specialty to examine your genes, and I find it absolutely necessary to use it in an in-person, hands-on test.

T-Rex: I will take the "A" test!

T-Rex: I will also conduct a full genetic profile!  You'll learn more about myself as a "A" in the print and begin to unravel the mystery surrounding my origin and fall from grace as a consequence of which of my parents was to become the tragic tragic tragic tragic tragic...

T-Rex: ... of course.
Utahraptor: Wait - what about my interest in superheroes?

T-Rex: Oh snap, YES.  Yes.  I'd do a "SIXX/S" test on my parents and the results will show me a SPACESHIP.  My parents will feel as though their only crime was NIBBLING AWAY from the very edge of their seat, feet splaying over the edge of their couch with a potato stuck between their teeth.

T-Rex: I didn't say "nibblers".

T-Rex: YES.  I'd do a Supersonic Superspy on the spot, and then they'd be all, "sup, I can now safely proclaim that I absolutely love the feeling of being grabbed by a punchline".
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: OH MY GOD
