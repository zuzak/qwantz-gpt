T-Rex: Once upon a time there was a prince who didn't like poo (that's down the street, I know, RIGHT NOW ITSELF) but then he got older and liked bigger and better poos.  And SO, he died.

T-Rex: So, there was this orderly who took poop out of people and placed it in a box.  And the person with the box could only poop their pants or whatever.
Dromiceiomimus: Like a big ol' bag of poop?
T-Rex: NO, the person with the box could ONLY poop their pants.  And the recipient of the poop had to pay a gazillion dollars to the person with the bigger box.

Utahraptor: But now, the person with the bigger box has to pay the government $1 million a year for the next few years to keep their secret!
T-Rex: I don't see any dollars.
