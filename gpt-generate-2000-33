T-Rex: You know when people say "It seems to me that all people fall into one set of three differentiations?"

T-Rex: Attention, audio diary!

T-Rex: Someone says, "You are both chemically different from someone else but still, we share a single set of three differentiations", and I say "That's a bit simplified and we share the same domain of perception".
Someone else says, "You are both carbondinos from another universe but still, we share a single domain of perception".

Someone else says, "You are both nuclear codinos from the binary search for generalizations".
Dromiceiomimus: I agree!
T-Rex: I too am chemically different from someone else, technically, technically.

Utahraptor: I disagree, dude!
T-Rex: Check it out: say you're both a nuclear (functional) and non-functional person!

T-Rex: You're both going to confuse each other up if any of them finds out you're both chemically different.
Utahraptor: That's not a advice thing!
T-Rex: oh yeah you're just saying
T-Rex: you should go check it out

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: oh my god i can't believe it
