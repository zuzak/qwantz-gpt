T-Rex: My new book is called "BILLY THE TEEN! BILLY IS A PASTE!" and is about... (GROSS)

T-Rex: Bill Wycliffe!

T-Rex: I wrote it myself, you guys! It was called "Mr. Bill" and was a T-Rex story. In the story, Bill was a little boy who got his first bite of a computer screen, who was always inventing new cool new cool ideas, who could never really stop, who was never really there for help, who was never really in control. And he's right in the middle.

T-Rex: We call it, "Another Mr. Bill, This Time, In A Chamber Full of Cages."

T-Rex: So it's a story about another fictional character called "Mr. Bill", right?
Dromiceiomimus: "In a Chamber Full of Cages"?
T-Rex: "In a smaller room, Bill was actually sitting on a chair next to several other characters, writing out numbers."

Utahraptor: What does "Another Mr. Bill" mean beyond the title?
T-Rex: "Another chapter of my awesome story, entitled "BILLY THE TEEN! Bill is a dinosaur, I should action him to death!"

T-Rex: It's awesome, Utahraptor. Bill wrote some amazing dinosaur stories, and I'm very much into this.
Utahraptor: Wow, you've really inspired me in the past few days. I don't see what's more important?
T-Rex: ...Proceed.

T-Rex: Congratulations all, I hope this doesn't come to nought yet!
