T-Rex: I have the best idea for a Batman comic. It's a Batman comic about a Batman who exists in our world, the real world. A BATMAN who exists in our world, the world of cartoon books. The issues are about a Batman who exists in our real world, but also BATMAN who exists in our real life.

T-Rex: I've got my OWN problems, right?

T-Rex: My problems are that I keep getting bit by two enormous dogs, and they keep getting bigger and bigger, always wanting more bit. And I don't just complain about the dogs: I SERIOUSLY SERIOUSLY SERIOUSLY SERIOUSLY FIGURATE I, I JUST - I WOULD TALK.
T-Rex: THE DOGS ARE GETTING LESS METEORIC AS WE GO.
T-Rex: AND I'M SURE I will evolve to be a special assistant to the dog, which would be pretty neat.

Utahraptor: So what's the comic about?
T-Rex: Dog problems!

T-Rex: Our closest friend is a dog who barkes and wiggles in the middle of a difficult situation. Dog problems! Dog problems with heads turned to pages of a book.
Utahraptor: A comic book?
T-Rex: Nope! Dog problems with heads turned to pages of a book!!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: WHAT THE HELL. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME TODAY. THANKS FOR READING THE COMIC.
T-Rex: I am now a super genius, thanks for being me
