T-Rex: I just realized that I have, in fact, made some friends in the past... by accident!

T-Rex: I will call this situation "Physical Travelling".

T-Rex: First off, I will assume that all travellers are behaving in the proper ways and, therefore, deserve to travel on foot.
T-Rex: If you are confused, please do not travel on foot; you will cause problems for everyone else!
T-Rex: Also, be sure to bookax your own skills so that you can make use of them in the future.

Utahraptor: This is an extremely difficult realization to swallow, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I know!

T-Rex: But it is, in fact, incredibly difficult.  Everyone must strive for a TINY success rate, and if possible, do not overthink it! Remember: this is just a recipe for discomfort.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, remember my delicious secret to friendship!

Narrator: SUDDENLY!
T-Rex: What the heck, man?
T-Rex: I forgot to forget my secret to friendship!
