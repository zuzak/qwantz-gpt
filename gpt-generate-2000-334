T-Rex: I'm a dude with lots of cool friends. Some of them are doctors, and some of them are athletes. Some of them are rappers and whatever.

T-Rex: Let's assume I'm the first one to say this!

T-Rex: All these guys have had some nice things happen, but on the whole, they're still not super friends. They're not good friends.
T-Rex: Oh well! Let's put aside our disagreements and work together to get this great great society going again.

Utahraptor: Hey, can we do that somehow T-Rex?
T-Rex: We'll certainly do it ourselves!

T-Rex: We'll get together and Sing the Obnoxious Quiz song, and we'll list all the things we've ever done that we'd like to get right. From now on, we're gonna be talking about the things we've done wrong.
Utahraptor: Okay!

T-Rex: Well! I'm going to be as "hilarious as possible" and talking about the things I wish I'd done instead.
T-Rex: I'm PRETTY SURE this has turned out pretty okay
