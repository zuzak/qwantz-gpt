Narrator: THINGS T-REX DID THAT ONE TIME BY DESIGN
T-Rex: That one is called "Tweezeraton" and is basically just a way for us to say "Wow, I wonder what's bothering you today?"

T-Rex: It's like - did Twitter ever get like this?

T-Rex: Well, okay, there's been reports of crazy things being said in the past, but that's clearly not a threat to anyone.  Tweezeraton is mainly used for reporting on things that didn't happen, or that weren't actually said at all.
Dromiceiomimus: This leaves us with one choice: we can say "This happened to be the case and you're the only one with any bearing", or we can say "Tweezeraton happened to be true", or we can say "Your silence is deafening!"  All this leaves us with one choice: we have a Twitter account to say whatever we want, and that's it!

Utahraptor: So how do you plan to use the power?
T-Rex: Just make it more interesting!

T-Rex: The more interesting Twitter becomes, the more we'll want to hear things like this.  So rather than saying "this happened to be true", we could say "this happened to be awesome!"  and then maybe we could, you know, CONTINUE THIS MONDAY TO 8 PM.
Utahraptor: How come expressing your own opinions is only used for reference? 
T-Rex: Because that's dumb??

T-Rex: Honestly, isn't?  It everyone?  It's just gets.  If everyone just stated "I wonder what's bothering me today" it wouldn't be dumb, because asking what things be doable is what gets us anything done.  Anything that gets us anything is what keeps us from doing anything.  So saying "I wonder what's bothering me today" is clearly just going to keep us from doing anything.
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I am offering you up!  I am offering YOU up!
