T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate foolproof way to be totally invisible!  He'll be able to be invisible for years, because we'll be able to look at him and make decisions without him being there!

[[Reproduced contract]]: To be as invisible as possible, we'll need to have an invisible friend!
T-Rex: AW. Let's do this.
Reproduced contract: Assuming everyone lives in the same house, and assuming there's a population of about 20 million!

T-Rex: All i've done is assign a friend with a certain age and gender to an imaginary population of 20 million people!
Utahraptor: Hey, who are you talking to?  Someone old?

T-Rex: I asked them because I thought maybe they'd be interested in being invisible, and they said hey, maybe they'll want to be invisible too.  But now I'm all over the invisible friend system, and it keeps on getting better.  It's like a reverse bar tax, except everyone ELSE has a certain height and weight but we only see them as a weight in our taxes, and everyone ELSE is basically invisible.  How do we get there?

Utahraptor: I don't know.  It's like Fran pouring livelier version of Fran's New Coke on the side of the road.
T-Rex: The side of the road?
Utahraptor: The side of the road?
T-Rex: The side of the road, please!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Utahraptor, thanks for the tip!  It's been a slow night for me.  But, OH MAN
T-Rex: I can at least drink some beer
