T-Rex: I am a guy who likes to keep my SECRET HISTORY SECRET RULES a secret. It's really important when you're a kid.

Narrator: SECRET HOMES
Narrator: (INSPIRED BY A COMIC inspired by my SECRET HOMES)

T-Rex: My secret is this: when I grow up, I want to be a super hero, but also to have the same high fantasy I have the next time I think, "Oh wow!" and punch a murderer.  It's a magic bullet that shoots out of my bullet, and if I knock someone off their feet, they'll shoot it back out again!  They'll make my dream a reality, but in the meantime, I'll be learning how to shoot things from a distance using only my two eyes!

Utahraptor: So the person going to jail gets to punch the murderer?
T-Rex: Yes!

T-Rex: They'll have to be careful with that, because if they do, the bullet will miss and go straight for the brain.  The murderer won't even be hung, and they'll just suffer the consequences!
Utahraptor: And the brain will fail?
T-Rex: Yes.  My brain will fail and I'll just have to fight crime with my two eyes, that's all!

Narrator: LATER: 
T-Rex: Everyone, stop being such a dweeb!
T-Rex: I didn't mean to!
