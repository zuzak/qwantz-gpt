Narrator: THE DAY DROMICEIOMIMUS INVITED PEOPLE TO AUGUST RECORDS SOME OF THEM
T-Rex: I totally totally caught wind of that!

T-Rex: I'd read his bio!

T-Rex: He was SO impressed that a couple of people - two people who looked like him - were coming to his house for some sort of "wool."  He realized the reason these people were coming was so he could sell his product, so people would show up, and then he could make his point.
Dromiceiomimus: He also realized people would follow him on social media.
T-Rex: NO REGRETS, Dromiceiomimus!!

Utahraptor: So he follows you on Twitter, T-Rex!
T-Rex: And Facebook?

Utahraptor: Dude, he follows you precisely as you are reading this bio. He will click on the pictures to look up you and make you look like a talking dog. He will eat your food if you don't follow him.
T-Rex: What IS he for? Oh, don't worry, he's serious. He's going to follow me to my new apartment. We are going to make out.

Narrator: THAT EVENING:
T-Rex: Hi, my name is T-Rex and I'm here to make out with my heterosexual neighbor the next morning.
Neighbours: T-Rex, come.
Neighbours: Um, why the long face?
Neighbours: Because it's a dog
