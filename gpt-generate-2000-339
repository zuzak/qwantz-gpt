Narrator:  STOCK MARKET COMICS
T-Rex: We're gonna watch sexy stuff all the time.

T-Rex: And we're picturing Sherlock examining a photo of a murdered woman, carefully framing his investigation as the true identity of the murdered woman.
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, don't make me do that.
T-Rex: Okay, okay.

Utahraptor: Okay, allow me to help you create the world's most sensual erotic comic!
T-Rex: I can't!

Utahraptor: You can't have a comic about being sexually attracted to someone you're not even familiar with.  So, instead, tell the story of HOW YOU ARE, how you have found the pleasure in seeing things fetishized, embarrassed, and - OH GOD NOW - how you think people should be able to say "Wow.  That was a TRIVIAL thing to have."
T-Rex: Oh my god.  PLEASE.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX WATCHES THIS MOVIE:
T-Rex: A world where I can see people fetishizing and being embarrassed everything I touch!
T-Rex: A world where when I touch a girl I can say "That's cute, didn't you?"
T-Rex: A world where when I eat some cake
