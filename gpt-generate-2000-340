T-Rex: Critical mass rides are when a hundred or more cyclists get together and go on a bike ride! They take over a lane of traffic and get to set their pace. The motto and politics are "we don't block traffic, we are traffic!"

T-Rex: It's a good thing - 
T-Rex: - that the older road rules were a little more "we don't make a traffic circle" friendly.

T-Rex: But now Critical Mass is just about taking over unblocked traffic and shouting "We don't block traffic, we are traffic!" while also carrying a sign that says "Blowing into the direction of traffic isn't allowed!"
T-Rex: That's not a very responsible government.

Utahraptor: But T-Rex, you're not shouting "we don't block traffic, we are traffic!"
T-Rex: I am! And I am and I continue to yell "we don't block traffic, we are traffic!"
T-Rex: And yet, when I see the sign at the side of the road that says "Not allowed", I'm not going to be so defensive?

T-Rex: People! Do you not see how ridiculous this is?
