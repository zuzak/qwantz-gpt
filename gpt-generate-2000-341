T-Rex: One day, Ryan his weirdo self blows on a power outlet in his living room, and then he walks up to the dude and says "Hey, my friends are awesome!"

T-Rex: I'm not sure what he's thinking!

T-Rex: What's clear is that after blowing on the power outlet, he went on a shopping trip, grabbed a bag of groceries, drove around in his car, and then packed those into his car. And yes, he did this CRAZY JOB.  He went from city to city, stopping to signal that he's got it all figured.
T-Rex: And YES, he did it in his car.

T-Rex: He bought a used car!
Utahraptor: We should've had some say... in the store?!

Utahraptor: Sure, he could've loaded the groceries into his car and driven around the city, stopping only at car washrooms or drop-off points. Instead, he chose the grocery store downtown.
T-Rex: ...WHAT

Utahraptor: I'm not buying that.
T-Rex: He's clearly lost his item.
