T-Rex: One day, the landroid found a large lump of rice in the ground.  He helped the rice farmer out!  The farmer bit it, and the ground grew TOO BIG.

T-Rex: FUN fact:  this happened in real life too!

T-Rex: The landroid decided to clean the lump up, but the landroids hands didn't notice so they stayed out and ABOUT.  So the next day the landroid started tending the ground, OKAY.  Today's one hundred and thirty-five years later, the landroid is still doing this!!

Utahraptor: So, the landroid started stomping on this radish.
T-Rex: No, better.  Today's the day we step out into the wild.

T-Rex: The landroid dug in his claws and said "This rot is gross, gross, gross" and the rot spread.  By now the landroid was stomping on tons of rot all at once!
Utahraptor: Wow!
T-Rex: I know!  Wow.

T-Rex: The next morning the landroid found the rice lump and started applying gentle rubbing alcohol to it to remove its nasty seeds.
T-Rex: The landroid was about to say "It's gross, gross" when the landroid yanked out a notebook and flipped it over.
T-Rex: The landroid was about to read a sentence that Utahraptor was going to read while she was stomping on this thing called rot

{{title text: "rot on the ground" is clearly a bad verb, so let's just accept that for now.  "rot on the ground" is clearly one of the WORST verbs ever.}}
