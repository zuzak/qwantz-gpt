T-Rex:  I've been writing fan fiction for years.  It's easy to imagine today, Dromiceiomimus!  When I look back on it, I hope I had a good time, because otherwise I might have made a terrible FAN FAN FAN FAN FAN Wednesday!

Dromiceiomimus:  But your characters spend the rest of the day either hanging out, eating, laughing, or traveling to other planets where there's less friction.
T-Rex:  Oh!  In some alternate reality, I'M not sure we even get to visit!

Utahraptor:  Fan fiction, right?
T-Rex:  Right.

T-Rex:  But in my story my character Emily Nussbaum is on another planet, and we both have her phone number.  And we're going to have an alternate universe where she is, technically, only here on Earth.
Utahraptor:  I -
T-Rex:  I was on another reality!

Narrator:  Later:
T-Rex:  I have, legally, created a two part matter that can only be formed by exploding food in a vat of ice cream cone.
T-Rex: Technically correct, legal person!
