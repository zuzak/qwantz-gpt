T-Rex: So in the 15th and 16th centuries, spoken English transformed into spoken French, transforming its grammar from mush from the 15th century into mush from the early 21st century!

T-Rex: It's amazing!

T-Rex: It was an amazing - golden age of spoken French! So amazing, in fact, that I transcribed it into part of a song for my iPhone.  "My mom keeps leaving me in the field pooring," it read.  "So I gave myself a try; her pooring made me a winner."
T-Rex: So interesting, Dromiceiomimus!!

Utahraptor: So you win the hearts and minds of his French-speaking French-speaking French-world!

T-Rex: Exactly my problem! He doesn't understand why I'm suddenly so intrigued.  He's so interested in ME, and his interest is ruining my whole evening.
Utahraptor: So what to do?
T-Rex: I'll just sit at home and listen to some crappy song until my interest abates.  Then I'll go to bed and sleep my natural English.
