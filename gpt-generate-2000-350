Narrator: "THE STORY OF A ROBOT"
Narrator: starring babes

T-Rex: What started as a joke turns into a serious business when you have something so enthralling that people say "How is this a good joke?" over and over until there's not even a smooch left on the JOE CONCLUDING AROUND in this comic.

Dromiceiomimus: Why are these boogers even wearing jeeps?
T-Rex: They're semaphore-clad, shambling, hairy cross-legged robots. Jeeps? NOBODY SAY that. Jeeps ARE sexy.
T-Rex: They're BUSY.

Utahraptor: You can't just throw a joke around and get people to think about it.
T-Rex: Indeed I can, and I will!

T-Rex: People will get the full meaning of "Jeep" in the most cynical, obsequious way possible, and those who do come back from the stuffed animals to laugh heartily in their own back yard.
Utahraptor: It is a laugh that is routinely denied to the boogie dudes who cannot see beyond the jeep.

T-Rex: Woah! Turns out that's true! And that's comedy gold, to kick off "Chuggy's Chuggy" and make "I Am the Jeep" the industry standard.
T-Rex: I'm laughing my head off right here, imagine my shock AND my self-doubt, and that's it for this comic
