T-Rex: JOKE THE THERMODY: suppose a) you're a guy who is pretty into his own body and b) you're super into your own body, thereby forming a symbiotica involving other people, I mean... your own body!

T-Rex: And c) this other guy is eating apple juice from a glass he just got thrown inside.

T-Rex: ...Huh.  Okay, so I'm gonna assume that this other guy is also a skeleton.  He's got this giant axe that he can use to cut meat, but he CANNOT THROUGH IT.  So this skeleton guy has to balance himself off, using his giant axe to his full potential.  And when he's not using it, he's good at it!  He spends his time eating apples!

T-Rex: So THIS skeleton guy has to balance being a skeleton on his own, somehow.  There's gotta to be some magical ability something he can use up to MINIMALLY use an other guy's apples.
Utahraptor: I think that's a possibility, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Really?  I thought that was off.

T-Rex: Yeah, I got that, yeah, I got that off-panel.  I'm out.  I don't know what I'm doing here.  I don't want to be the guy who ends up eating something that he can't even THRUST through because it's AMAZINGLY DANGEROUS?
Utahraptor: I don't think so!  I think that's who you are.
T-Rex: Well, that's easy! I'm going to learn how to be a skeleton.
