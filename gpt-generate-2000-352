T-Rex: So the average life expetancy is how often the parties are. It's what happens when you spend a day with an ex-girlfriend. Also: if the ex-girlfriend is nice, you'll feel better about herself and so will she!

T-Rex: And when she's not being nice to you, SHE'S BEING nice to you!

T-Rex: And THAT'S how you measure success.  If the ex-girlfriend is awesome, you'll know she is.  If the ex-girlfriend is slutty, she'll be perfect and she'll have slutty friends.  If the ex-girlfriend is awesome, you'll know she's super horny and you'll know she's super horny chicks and guys.  

Utahraptor: So, a measure of success is writing well-written screenplays!
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: And, YES, an important dashboard is a must-read for all sex fans!  A must-read that will sell lots of copies!  So, say, a thousand copies of that book will be.  That's a real good sexy numbers!
Utahraptor: And, a thousand copies sold?

T-Rex: That's a reasonable number for a sexy numbers-focussed society!  Plus, a thousand sells you the book you're looking for, so you might as well re-read it!
T-Rex: YOU'LL BE THANKING ME IN PARTICULAR
