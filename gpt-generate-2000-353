T-Rex: I'm not impressed!  Why aren't I drinking martinis from a giant pole?

T-Rex: Time for me to meet someone who'll take me back to the future...

T-Rex: ... using the future as my personal portal!
Dromiceiomimus: ...Going back to the future?
T-Rex: No!  Not for me!  I've come back... TO... THE FUTURE.

T-Rex: I'll be the smartest person of this generation, and I'll have the coolest ideas.  But when I use the future as a portal, I'll be... trapped!
Utahraptor: Why?

T-Rex: I don't understand!  Why are we still so hung up on the past that doesn't really tell us anything new?  We've hung it up until this moment, and it doesn't even make sense to tell us what we should and should't be doing.  Why are we casting this as-yet-untested technology that we'll have to put in our dishes?  Why are we abandoning tribalism and move to a more serene new world?

T-Rex: Time for me to win back some of my MAMMAL BROTHERS by making sure my favourite song doesn't make the same mistakes again!!
[[Off-panel voice]]: NOTHING TO DO, KNOWLEDGE ON SINGLE PEOPLE WITH AN UNOMPRESSED INSIDE THE BED: AMAZING
T-Rex: I dunno man, I heard it!!
