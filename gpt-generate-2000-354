T-Rex: I am a generous guy!  I don't take presents so much anymore, Dromiceiomimus!  I don't buy crackers and candies and stuff when the kids are at home.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm sorry T-Rex, but we're having a crisis on our hands.
T-Rex: IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE!

Utahraptor: I'm sorry T-Rex, I got cold feet here!
T-Rex: Oh well, at least we're all going to have to stay in better jobs soon.

Utahraptor: Well, here's how you deal with this.  Don't come to our parties.
T-Rex: Oh crap!  Our friggin' parties are getting pretty bad!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Wait up for a bus that's making round trip inbound and reverse-uh-oowww!
Off-screen Character: I don't understand why we're even having this conversation
T-Rex: It's TANTALY PITY I keep my head screwed tight against the wall next to me!
Off-screen Character: I wonder what's going on here
