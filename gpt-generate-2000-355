T-Rex: I am a guy who has a lot of friends.  I'm not super great, but I am at least super great for having friends.  I mean, I'm friends with my FOUR FRIENDS, and they're all great.  I'm friends with two HISTORIANS, and they're all - excellent friends?  I don't know.  I'm starting to drift.

T-Rex: Maybe I'm not FARS' best friend, Dromiceiomimus!

Dromiceiomimus: No it's not, T-Rex.  We're good FRIENDS, but we're not super good FOR HOW WE CRACKETS.  We're not "the solid gold standard" friends.  Our conversations are like chips; if we don't mix some, we lose our chips.
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: ...And that's a problem for us

Utahraptor: But what if we had friends only at weddings and not at parties?
T-Rex: ...

Utahraptor: That's the other problem with me!
T-Rex: ...Yes?
Utahraptor: The other problem is that I'm starting to feel like I belong in a music video for "Good Ol' B!"
T-Rex: Oh God.
T-Rex: That's the second problem!

Narrator: SHORTLY:
