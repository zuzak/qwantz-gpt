T-Rex: You know when people say "You know what the saddest thing would be?" and they're all, "To give up our little day to look at the sad and the eternally sad?"

T-Rex: It's because we're all pretty terrible at that, right?

T-Rex: And we're all dumb, which is fine. We're all underinformed and under-motivated, which is fine. We're all in debt and we're all in a bind.
Dromiceiomimus: But at least we're all doing okay!
T-Rex: Okay, that was pretty sad, but you take all the time??

Utahraptor: But at least we're all being great and stepping up!
T-Rex: YES.

Utahraptor: And with the economy tanking and house values going up?
T-Rex: That's what I'm saying.
Utahraptor: That's depressing.
T-Rex: Oh man!!
T-Rex: I'm literally saying the word "crap"!
