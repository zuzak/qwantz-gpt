Narrator: TIPS FOR HETEROSEXUAL MEN

T-Rex: First off, turn on your best friends and think about what they want to be friends with. Are they going to marry someone who looks like you? If not, what? If you're down with that, then you may as well skip a few chapters and just be yourself!
Dromiceiomimus: Hah! Um. I was wondering if you saw someone who looks like you on the bus?
T-Rex: Man, that's not a real friend!

Utahraptor: Handy mnemonic for friendship!
T-Rex: Yeah man!

T-Rex: So you're a dude who is kind of a distance-averaging nerd, but ALSO a FRIEND of some sort! He's like a dude who has been a spare in a forgotten secret society, only you never showed up for class and spent the whole adventure wondering why you were wasting your time.
Utahraptor: Exactly!

Utahraptor: Also, there's like a billion and a half single variables who don't really add up to a "friendship", and you just keep on pretending not to know anything about them.
T-Rex: Man! Turns easy friends on themselves.

T-Rex: Turns easy PEOPLE on themselves.
