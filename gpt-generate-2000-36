T-Rex: I have come up with an excellent way to have my Wikipedia changed without even trying: RIGHTS!

T-Rex: I will be able to write awesome things for money for the smarts of everyone!

T-Rex: For example, suppose I am wrong about Spider and Guildleuth and suppose that the Wikipedia entries I am about to write are ones about love and how they all make her feel.  I will then get emails from people who are just like me, and then I will get to write awesome stuff for them.  It will be the magic of the internet!

Utahraptor: T-Rex!  I thought this was just a website for fun things to laugh at!
T-Rex: Aw, no.  That's plagiarism.

Utahraptor: Yeah, but it's magical!  You can take a book and put it on a website and make it TOTALLY amazing.  Doesn't that sound like work?
T-Rex: Come on, Utahraptor, for the love of T-Rex, is WAY TOOR AWESOME.

T-Rex: Alright!  I have a solution:  a "magic ring"!
T-Rex: It will cost you at the grocery store, but you will be responsible for paying the bill - and you will get awesome stuff!
T-Rex: For example, suppose the magic happened to me to get me some awesome things!
