T-Rex: I have come up with the ULTIMATE COMEBACK to be used on musicians! First, I'll make a sandwich, but I'll also play some punch line. Then I'll get some breadcrumbs and a meat-flavoured bun, split equally amongst the two men, and then I'll put my hands up so they're parallel to the ground. Finally, I'll stuff the bread with some philatepants and patois, and then I'll finish off the patois with some bacon.

T-Rex: I'll thank these men for their friendship!
Utahraptor: I'll use it for good?

T-Rex: Perhaps! But please enjoy!
T-Rex: Listen, I'm putting all this in my own personal potential.
