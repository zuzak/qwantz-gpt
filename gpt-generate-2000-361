T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for talking about my lovemaking!  I just discovered your sweetie.

T-Rex: I had no idea you were as into kissing as I!

T-Rex: I love the two of us very much.  I love the fact that we share a bed, and that you are both smokin' hot.  I love the fact that you are both so into smokin' smokin' smokin'.  I love the fact that I am the centre of the story.  I love the fact that you are all loving yourself, so. Much.

Utahraptor: So what are you thinking, baby?
T-Rex: What? No!

Utahraptor: No! Lovemaking!
T-Rex: What?! Lovemaking's the act of loving someone else's sweetie... WITH a fork?
T-Rex: Why, it's the first time I've ever mentioned the topic to anyone, and I'm worried that if I told you it would befall all my friends, you might start to suspect me!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hey, I met you at a party!
Person: What?
T-Rex: I'm not even dating
