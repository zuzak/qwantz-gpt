T-Rex:  Let us start with the simplest assumption:  no matter what we do, we're doing something different!  And that implies  that we're  doing something different too!

T-Rex:  Yes!  Is that a thing?

T-Rex:  Because it is!  And we can express this by using simple LOGIC-MAKES, just as we can express simple quantities by using simple maximum generalizations.
Dromiceiomimus:  But you'd only use simple generalizations if all you do is generalize large sums of unaudited binary numbers.
T-Rex:  Oh my God!  That's so lame!

Utahraptor:  I think you are!
T-Rex:  Oh my God!  That's so lame!

Utahraptor:  I think you're a dude who always pretends to be a math person, only to really be an engineer person who can do ANYTHING.
T-Rex:  Oh my God!  That's such a terrible assumption!

T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Today I learnt a bit about people who get beat up!
T-Rex: Aw, who am I to say what they think!
