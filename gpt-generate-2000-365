T-Rex: I have a friend who got an email invitation to a boxing dinner. She got the email invitation because when she arrived at the boxing dinner invitation office the guy behind her said "Mary, come here first. We're going to enjoy a meat sandwich." She said "I don't know, man" and he said "You're not allowed to ask questions here" and she said "What's the email address?"

T-Rex: It was crazy!

T-Rex:  Man, how do you get emails inviting you to a boxing dinner?  I mean, there are like, 140 characters that people will get who will answer questions on the boxing dinner invitee website.
Dromiceiomimus:  "The person who will lead the charge in this class is signed to be prime mo-
T-Rex:  Prime mo-

Utahraptor: Prime mo-!

T-Rex: Prime mo-!  Prime mo-!  Prime mo-!  And finally, his email address is ".@Mary.TrustyBarker2.MyGuysSoHo-HoIs.Guilty as charged."
Utahraptor: That's what the guy meant, yeah.
T-Rex: That's what the email said.
Utahraptor: Can we assume it's signed?
T-Rex: Can we assume it's honest, even though it's clearly meant to be honest?

T-Rex: Can we also assume it's run the gamut of awesome??
