Narrator: COMPRESSED SONG COMICS
T-Rex: One day Jim Rifle wanted to shoot some game birds, so he invented the rifle, and decided to do it by accident! He was tripping some ducks on his way to work when he tripped a lady bird, and accidentally shooting his own bird!

T-Rex: People love to make jokes about how dumb they are!

T-Rex: Luckily for him, nobody was tripping any birds this year!  Jim Rifle himself was tripping some birds, but nobody was saying he should shoot.  Instead, he was saying he should avoid the coast.  It was this:

T-Rex: VERY VERY VERY important.

T-Rex: This is why I left early one morning for a week working on my own personal holodeck, called "Holodex".
Utahraptor: You're making this sound boring!

T-Rex: It's not!  It's like an old holodex "sandwich", only instead of breadcrumbs it's chips.  Um, better.  Also, it's made of solid gold and nobody wants to buy it because it's "un-holy".
Utahraptor: Really?
T-Rex: That's exactly as accurate as I would've liked it to be!
