T-Rex: I've come across a way of making movies better. Better, I think, than by any chance I've had so far! Better still, better because better because better everyone doing their best.

T-Rex: I call it, "Make It Better?"

T-Rex: The problem is that even when people have the better movies, they're still sometimes not getting things done. Sometimes the BEST things happen to the BEST people, and that's sad. Maybe if weanced apart, we'dall be better off without you? Maybe, just MAYBE if more people got along, we'd all be better off without you.
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe if more people got along, WE'D be better off without you?
T-Rex: MAYBE we'd all be better off without you

Utahraptor: Maybe if more people got along, WE'D be better off without you?
T-Rex: MAYBE we would all be better off without YOU

T-Rex: PLEASE PAY PAINTER SELLERS
