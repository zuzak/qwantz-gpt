Narrator: HOW TO BE A "PHILOSOPHICAL TALKING BOX"

T-Rex: The first time I talked to someone was while walking on water. 

T-Rex: If you don't have a PHILOSOPHICAL talking box, you're not going to impress me! 
Dromiceiomimus: It's a physical T-Rex box, T-Rex! 
T-Rex: Um. 
T-Rex: If you don't have a physical T-Rex box, I'm not going to impress you either!

Utahraptor: You're not going to impress me just because you lack a physical talking box!
T-Rex: I'm not!

Utahraptor: You're ALSO not going to impress me because you're not impressed with people who lack PHILOSOPHICAL talking boxes! 
T-Rex: Man! 
T-Rex: People with physical boxes should really just get used to  thinking "MAN, I'll get NUMBERS with my thoughts, and I'm probably going to get a BUNCH!"
