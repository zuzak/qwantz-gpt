T-Rex: I'm a dude who always has some secret. Oh man, so does that mean I have a secret to share?!

T-Rex: That's my SHOCKING SECRETS.

T-Rex: They are these tiny little keys I've been putting away for like - ages? 
Dromiceiomimus: They are, really. 
T-Rex: Amazing! 

Utahraptor: So what's the secret?
T-Rex: Oh goodness, I don't know. 

T-Rex: It's just I've been assuming that the classic "old news" sound of the time had disappeared. 
Utahraptor: But are these even a secret? 
T-Rex: They are NO longer being shared between friends, and even strangers can get a little jealous of them! 

Narrator: YEARS LATER, T-REX TRIES IT AND UTAHRAPTOR'S SECRET KEY IS STILL NOT ACTUALLY EVER LOST.
T-Rex: Oh my gosh!!
T-Rex: It's so interesting
