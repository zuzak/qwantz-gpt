Narrator: T-REX HAS RUN OUT OF STUFF TO SAY THE SAMETHING TO BUTCH AGAIN
T-Rex: I've got some problems!

T-Rex: First, I get angry, which is normal. Then I feel useless and pointless, and finally, when I throw a punch that hits butCHER, I feel like I'm putting on too much weight and that I should start keeping my cool. I don't want to be T-Rex.
T-Rex: I'm SUCH A BUTCH.

Utahraptor: Then?
T-Rex: Oh, um, I just -- I didn't realize the anger was suddenly coming from within me.

T-Rex: Utahraptor, it's okay. I won't say that I am a butch boy.
Utahraptor: Okay.
T-Rex: Well, that's going to be okay. I'm going to start out small, small saving T-Rex the Chameleonic Fruit of the Largest Trees, and follow that up with a large salad of our choosing.

God: GUYS SO SURE CAN't wait to see what you've got inside you
T-Rex: I promise! Soon we'll be running water filters and putting food on the line WHENEVER we want!
God: GUYS SO SURE CAN
T-Rex: Soon!!
