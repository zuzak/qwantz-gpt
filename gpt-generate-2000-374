T-Rex: It is well-established that the body experiences change over time.  One of the main messages of the brain is that these changes are reversible!

T-Rex: For instance: some people experience being born heavier and grow up to be able to be born lighter.

T-Rex: This is not a new idea!  In fact, it was first proposed by the late Dr. Stephen T. Kirkpatrick, MD.
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, did you hear that we're actually immortal?
T-Rex: No, I actually meant that EVERYONE DECIDES to die in a "good" way?

Utahraptor: Actually, no!
T-Rex: Dr. Kirkpatrick, that is the first premise of "Sleepytime With Your Mom"!

Utahraptor: Yeah?  We're DECIDING sleep to be a... natural process?
T-Rex: No, I actually meant that to be an inanimate object...
T-Rex: ...which ALSO sounds awesome??

Narrator: LATER, AT HOME: T-REX VISITS A DONATION PAGE FOR "SLEEPING"!
T-Rex: Wow.  I can't believe I didn't see it before.
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, you made it sound like there was a real-life person giving out free tickets to sleep shows!!
