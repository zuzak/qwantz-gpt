T-Rex:  Hello, friend!  I didn't say anything exciting, I said just want to go out and have a meal with some friends.  So!

Narrator:  HALLOWE'EN COMEBACK
T-Rex:  ...What? You're not even in my mood!
Dromiceiomimus:  Hello, T-Rex!  It's great!  You've got a great time, you've got some very important business to look forward to discussing!
T-Rex:  Oh man!  Come back.  I sure need to go drop a barf!"

Utahraptor:  What?  You're making a barf called "flier" out of cardboard and duct tape!
T-Rex:  And don't you get to use duct tape!

T-Rex:  It's a confusing box that includes the word "factory" and on the bottom of the box has the words "Barbarian" and "DIY".  The bottom one contains the words "Are you sure you got the juice for this delicious meal?"
Utahraptor:  I got it from here!
T-Rex:  YES.  I'm clean now!!

Narrator:  LATER:
T-Rex:  It was delicious!
