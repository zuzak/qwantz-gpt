Narrator: ALTERNATE HISTORY COMICS
T-Rex: It started when a group of scientists came up with an amazing fact!

T-Rex: All stars had long-distance phone lines, and star travel was super exciting!

T-Rex: But star travel wasn't just for star travel, and for some, it was a PURE TOOTH death stare out the door.  They used star trek to get to the point where all stars were there, and they used fallout to get there!  But all this allowed the star trekkers to explore the planet further, and found they couldn't just hop on a spaceship and visit a planetoid they couldn't visit.  They had to rely on technology.

T-Rex: So they teamed up with NASA and other sources of funding and made use of the agency's Long-Toaster Program.  The Long-Toaster Program was a bunch of acronyms that were shortened to "S-4 SkyDome".
Utahraptor: That's awesome!  It was the FIRST program ever put in place to ensure long-distance phone service was provided on a planetary scale.

T-Rex:  However, due to a misunderstanding, NASA has not been the first to use them.  The program has not been used by the FUTURE to date.
