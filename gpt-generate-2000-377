T-Rex: Is it possible to have too many friends?

T-Rex: I think so!

T-Rex: How can you have too many friends if you're not the best friend ever?
Dromiceiomimus: Well if there's one thing we've got, it's pals!  We pick up on things that matter us, like when we're not pals!
T-Rex: That's true!  And we'd be a great support group for someone who needs everyone to be so great!

Utahraptor: I really don't see how we're going to build a sustained friendship without making allowances for differences.
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yeah!  We're going to friend and nod our head as if we're both super-great and awesome friends.  But there'll be differences.  Like what if we've got claws and we've got mouths and we talk like a ninja but our CLOTONIC LANGUAGE skills don't have any impact!
T-Rex: We're all dead!

T-Rex: What's the big news here, Utahraptor?  Long distance means you can't talk to other people at the same time and it's not like we had that problem in real life!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, my friendship with you wasn't all bad, it was all great.  You know when you'd go out for dinner and you'd be all, "My friends, I'm always available! I'd talk to you later; it's late; I was hungry" and then later, "But y'all, everyone I know is dead!" and then you'd be all, "Geez.  I'm going to get used to being friends with strangers.  I need to work on that."

T-Rex: Man!  That sounds like the kind of advice someone would give to someone who was fixing their life to start a new one!
T-Rex: However, it's ALSO not the sort of advice that gets us in a relationship.
