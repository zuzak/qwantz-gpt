T-Rex: Alright, so I never read any of the Voyager stories.  This is like my weird new reality!

T-Rex: But I totally missed out on reality's most popular character, who, UN SUFFICIENTLY, has a very special place in reality.

T-Rex: She's Captain Cook of the finest cups, juice, who cooks with love and understanding, who has the poise and technique to perfectly harness the forces of evolution and the entire universe's greatest intellect! And she's pregnant with a child, and it's so hot out, so the baby won't reach her at all! 

Utahraptor: Captain Cook and his ultimate offspring arrive to take back the cup!
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: The only thing better than friggin' Earth is the knowledge that, despite their best efforts, the baby on the other hand is still born out of this Earth-owning hell-bent on devouring the rest of the universe. 
Utahraptor: That's some universe-owning hell-owning juice, bro!

T-Rex: No way dude!  I'm literally saying this is definitely one chance for me to get out of Earth and get some delicious cup of juice!
T-Rex: AND IT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE WHEN SOMEONE SUDDENLY DIES.
T-Rex: Aw man!!
T-Rex: I'm getting INSANELY DROWNING HIGH FIVES
