T-Rex: When I had my first crush on a girl, I always sort of imagined she'd be an astronaut.  And maybe a fireman.  Maybe a fireman and fireman bot, because they're the ONLY robots I've ever seen pull off a crush.  Then they pull off a second crush, and I'm like, OH, what the HELL? Is she serious?  I'm serious!!  I'm serious now!

T-Rex: I've realized that even when I'm dreaming about a girl, I'm totally dreaming about an astronaut!

T-Rex: It's THE only fantasy I can come up with.  People who are really serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about - seriously?  It's terrific.
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, it's also terrific when people are serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about - oh, no.

T-Rex: Oh, wait.  Oh, wait, I forgot about that crush!
Utahraptor: Yeah!

Utahraptor: I was thinking about the crush you had there.  You had a crush on a girl.  But a crush on a girl?  Nobody has been more serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about - oh, no.

T-Rex: Oh, wait.  Wait, I forgot all about that crush!
Utahraptor: I was thinking about the crush you had there.  Nobody has been more serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about being serious about - oh, no.

T-Rex: Oh, wait.  Wait, I forgot about that crush!
