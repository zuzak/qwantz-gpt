T-Rex: It turns out some dinosaurs even have heads stuck in them! Turns out THESE dinosaur heads are like - natural cones?

T-Rex: I'll tell you what I find SO UNGLUELESS that it's easy to digest!

T-Rex: DINOSAUR AS SHE IS PLAYED:

T-Rex: When a raptor reaches a stage where his head is visible, he walks around and places his hand on the stage. You can almost see the raptor's eyebrows arched up when he looks up. "DO YOU WANT TO PARTY EACH SIX AND/OR CINEMATIC SECRET DO YOU FULLY FORGOT TO GET YOUR LIFE RIGHT" he says, his voice breaking.
T-Rex: You're not allowed to dance! This is our song. PLEASE DANCE AS I LAUGH; THIS PITCHING IS NOT FORGOTTEN.

Utahraptor: The song starts:

T-Rex: "I was so young and stupid but now I know how to get a date!!"
Utahraptor: Then the producer of the song, Bill Cosby, says "You're fired".
T-Rex: Then the producer of the song, LITREY, SAYS "You blew it, my friend!!"
T-Rex: That's it! We're done for!

Narrator: LATER, CONGRESS AND JUDGE BILL CHAIR:
Judge: All testimony?
T-Rex: None.
T-Rex: It was just a little while ago.
