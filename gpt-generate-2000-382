T-Rex: I'm not saying there's a right answer to the question "What is the theme song about?" because there isn't one! There's just not an "IV".

T-Rex: We need a theme song that reflects the person as organ, as wide-eyed and unblemished as ever.
T-Rex: SEE? THIS IS MY LUNCH!

T-Rex: Hi, Dromiceiomimus. Do you have any ideas for a theme song?
Dromiceiomimus: Um, what?
T-Rex: Okay, great, but what makes the song so compelling is how it starts off like a normal song, but then progresses to become a rousing 60 seconds of screaming, screaming, and then the chorus.
T-Rex: And we're the last ones to cheer!

Utahraptor: We're going to cheer!
T-Rex: And THEN we're going to cheer until we're either horribly misty-eyed, or, even MORE MORALISTICALLY, dead.

Utahraptor: Then we're going to cheer until death! Then we're going to cheer until we get that final kick of the crowd when they died. Then we're going to cheer until the last second, only they died anyway, and then we're going to beep "That was good o' life!"

T-Rex: ...That was probably the best cheer I've ever heard.
T-Rex: WAIT A MINUTE. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S WHERE HE IS RIGHT NOW.
