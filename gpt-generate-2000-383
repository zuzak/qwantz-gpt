T-Rex:  Hello, Dromiceiomimus!  Or should I say. . . EMILY??

T-Rex:  Because THIS is the question that robs me of all inhibitions, as all I'll ever be able to remember is how, in the blink of an eye, Mary Shelley transformed a story of Shelley-esque Shelley into Shelley-esque Shelley-esque Shelley-esque
Dromiceiomimus:  It's a great Shelley story, with Mary Shelley and early Frankenstein stories!
T-Rex:  Excuse me, Dromiceiomimus, as to your erotic politics?  I just wanted to know which Mary Shelley story is the most repugnant.

Utahraptor:  It's Mary Shelley-esque, T-Rex!
T-Rex:  Excuse me!

Utahraptor:  And the story is set in the Victorian world, so it must be Mary Shelley-esque.
T-Rex:  I thought maybe Mary Shelley-esque was Mary Shelley's?

Utahraptor:  Or early Mary Shelley-esque Mary Shelley's Shelley's Mary & Mary squabbling over who has the better story?
T-Rex:  FRIGGIN' DAY.
T-Rex:  Friggin' Mary Shelley's Mary squabbling over who has the better story?
