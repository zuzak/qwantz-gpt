T-Rex: I'm a dude with a lot of STUNNING SUPERPOWERS. I just wanna take them out.
T-Rex: No wait! Take them out!!
T-Rex: OH MY GOD.

T-Rex: DUDE, I know it's bad, but I just wanna take them out!!

T-Rex: No wait! Take them out!!
T-Rex: OH MY GOD, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex what?
T-Rex: I'm not sleepy. I'm not hungry.
T-Rex: DROMICEIOMIMUS. I don't know what you're thinkin' here, Dromiceiomimus.

T-Rex: You don't even care what happensin' in my dream! All I want to do is get some sleep.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, have you considered other options?

T-Rex: I'm still in favour of dreams, Utahraptor! Sleeping alone? Sure. Like a pretty girl? I'm thinkin' it!
Utahraptor: Sure!
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: And if that's not the case... HAVE YOU ASKED? Because if it isn't, then this dream isn't dreaming - it's waking up!
T-Rex: rolling in a beach; kissing a pretty girl; making out; holding off making out; -
T-Rex: aw shucks
