T-Rex: It's Wednesday! Ladies and gentlemen: Ladies and gentlemen: Ladies and gentlemen!!

T-Rex: Ladies and gentlemen, I am a new dude, and I have the added benefit of being incredibly horny.

T-Rex: Just like everyone else, I've made a terrible decision!

T-Rex: I'm going to call the cops! I was planning on going in to the bank, but it turns out it's the T-Rex police, and they were called the "Trees of the Earth"! They are the most dangerous units to own if you're planning a road trip (go to the bank, charge your card, no?).
Dromiceiomimus: The plan with the trunks is that the cards will be inside the branches, but the cards won't get damaged through the ATM work.

Utahraptor: The cards WILL NOT INFER the kind of damage you're concerned about.
T-Rex: Exactly!!

T-Rex: I'd say the problem is the ATM ITSELF. The whole thing is so dumb that even if you're just touching the slot, the card will travel through the hole.
Utahraptor: The thought of that happening to you makes me very angry.
T-Rex: Yes! Yes I am!!

T-Rex: And I'm not the only one who's angry!
T-Rex: I'm talking about EVERYONE else's dumb decisions, everybody!
T-Rex: Not even the guys who were proposing the ATM problem as "worse than cancer".
