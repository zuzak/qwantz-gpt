T-Rex: One day, the land on Earth and the water on Earth got swapped! Water on Earth was par with beautiful land that had been burned by aliens for food! The aliens decided to move to another planet to avoid this, but some Earth citizens were burned by aliens on another planet for no reason!

T-Rex: One planet to the left: United States!

T-Rex: But that was before we had computers!  Before we had the internet! And before we had the internet, we had the ability to talk to one another and talk back and figure out our common interests!
Dromiceiomimus: So what happened? Where did all this technology go?
T-Rex: I don't know!

T-Rex: I think it's going to be developed eventually.  It's like a phone that nobody has to use anymore, except for special cases such as tourists who don't require a doctor's note for their post-doctor phone note deal.
Utahraptor: It's a great deal, T-Rex!  Plus you get a note on the back that says "this phone is a loan shark, DON'T TELL THEM".

T-Rex: So it's a great deal!  But since the technology existed at the end of the industrial revolution, it can be extrapolated to be the best we can possibly do!
Utahraptor: Really?
T-Rex: Yep!  Estimates put the cost of a phone in the billions of dollars!
