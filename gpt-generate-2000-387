T-Rex:  Everyone wants to be successful in life, but they also want some money to try to make it so.  If you want to be successful at life, you should work toward increasing your self-esteem, both personally and in the larger society.

T-Rex:  By increasing your self esteem, you can further reduce your social support system.  

T-Rex:  People with esteem feel bad about failing, but they're also more satisfied with their current situation!  
T-Rex:  Sucky for our society, I must respectfully disagree!!  
T-Rex:  Once we have a measure of esteem, we can proceed to find a cure!

T-Rex:  Someone must feel bad about letting down their androgyny by failing to achieve the cure they so desire!!
Utahraptor:  "Feel bad about letting down your self esteem by failing to achieve your desire!"

T-Rex:  Exactly!  
Utahraptor:    So the next best thing you can do is make sure you are happy?   and increase your self esteem?

T-Rex:  And thereby increasing your own chance of becoming successful!
Utahraptor:    That seems pretty weak, you know?   
T-Rex:  ...Yes.      I am now convinced that I have truly succeeded in my mission, and the task at hand is far more challenging than I initially thought.
