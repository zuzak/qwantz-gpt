T-Rex: I have the best joke for Dromiceiomimus. Uh, AGAIN.

T-Rex: IT'S A NONSENSICAL PROBLEM T-REX HAS

T-Rex: What kind of joke does "I've got a good laugh" have? One where I say "Hey, Oxford comma guys! I've got a good laugh!" and then when I'm finished I go "Here, put the comma down. It's been a good jerk around the girl."
Dromiceiomimus: I - I'm not sure I'd go "Kissed."
T-Rex: You can come up with your joke without the comma though.

Utahraptor: It doesn't work that well, my friend!
T-Rex: It does!

T-Rex: It just doesn't. It's like a boxing joke, only with the person in the ring. It doesn't even work that way. It's like, even if I'm in the ring, I'm not going to land a punch, knock down a body, and then go back to punching their way out. It just doesn't.
Utahraptor: That's a great joke.

Utahraptor: Exactly. It just doesn't work that well.
T-Rex: I'm not going to BOLD sentence structure explain this?
T-Rex: Please!
