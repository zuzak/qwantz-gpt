T-Rex: I just had the greatest idea for a business ever. Oh MY goodness. It's a restaurant!

T-Rex: It's going to be called... "The Ultimate Dessert Bar-B-Queer"?

Dromiceiomimus: It's actually a sandwich bar, T-Rex, and the owner is also a sandwich bar owner.
T-Rex: IT'S A SANDWICH BAR-B-QueER MERELY.  It's delicious and the chicks are going to eat it for free!
Dromiceiomimus: It's literally a sandwich bar, please.

Utahraptor: What does it mean?
T-Rex: It means that the chicks are getting SUPER EXTREME.

T-Rex: And as I said before, the restaurant is basically a sandwich bar, with a side of fries on the side, and there's a stand at the back where you can put your favourite fries.  It's a great way to kick-start your evening!
Utahraptor: Huh.
T-Rex: There's actually a line at the end of the restaurant to ask if you want some fries. 

Narrator: ANYWAY, SOON! "THE Ultimate Dessert Bar-B-Queermerly"?
T-Rex: Um.
T-Rex: That's what it means??
