T-Rex: The problem with Superman is that he's so flawed in every way possible: the flaws only added to his brilliance. He doesn't understand why people would want to invest their money somewhere else for him. He just doesn't understand.

T-Rex: Why oh why are we paying attention in the first place?!

T-Rex: Let's fix this! The only issue is how the people closest to the character are buying his properties right now! Why invest his time and talent, money well, and effort into something that could one day fail?
Dromiceiomimus: Why not just put him through a series of tests, one of them being the simple amount of truth that Superman can be as accurate as possible?
T-Rex: BENEFICIARY.

Utahraptor: Superman's not an act! He's a machine. A machine that learns, that anyone who fails can be saved, and that's scored in the "100%" range!
T-Rex: And the score is written on the reverse polar opposite of the truth?

Utahraptor: Yeah! The polar opposite is that the only discrepancy between the two is that Superman doesn't learn very well.
T-Rex: Dude. You're right; I was right.

T-Rex: I'm afraid that this will be very productive in the future.
Utahraptor: Right. I'm afraid that by discrediting you, we risk alienating our most popular character.
T-Rex: Man!
T-Rex: CLASSIC LADY.
