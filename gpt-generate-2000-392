T-Rex:  Dudes!  Raccoons are cute, because they have to be!  They are cute.

T-Rex:  They are cute because they don't hassle me.  They're cute, because when I tap them on the head, they ALWAYS reply "oh yeah I know what I want, a bite of pie, so I'm going to accomodate a robot footmeeple".
T-Rex:  I'M not going to mess up my conversational strategy with a good T-Rex phrase!

Utahraptor:  The phrase is "to induce a temporal lobe sensory nerve fiber fiber-cortex connection to the cortex and to the limbic system in which I meant, but is of course wrong because the DLPFC does not".
T-Rex:  NICE IT.

T-Rex:  I'm not convinced my friend made the correct distinction.
Utahraptor:  Well, there's the philosophical!
T-Rex:  BECAUSE I APOLOGIZE FOR THE PUTTING MY FINGER IN THE MOUTH??

T-Rex:  FOR CRITICAL I AM A LIVING PERSON.
T-Rex:  BUT I'M COOL WITH FRIENDS
