T-Rex: I've decided to become an undead detective!

T-Rex: I will become... MURDEROUS.

T-Rex: Okay, so zombies happen to be the easiest ones to become characters in the story, so classier. First I'll be dealing with zombies, and then the second person will be zombies. Zombies become more and more disgusting as they get older, so BY THE TIME THAT SENTENCE OF "Zombie" THEY HAVE SWAPPED IN THEIR GYM and are hiding under cover in a zombie burrow. The end!

Utahraptor: This may sound terrible, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I know!

T-Rex: But it's really just going to be to ask the third party for autobio evidence, which he'll probably do through clenched teeth. It'll be the only way we can salvage some sense of direction from the situation.
Utahraptor: Aaaand basically it's cheap acting!

T-Rex: BUT!
T-Rex: The guy has no idea what acting like a detective is!
Utahraptor: Is this a... Check.
T-Rex: Is this a check to make sure I act weird and evil?
