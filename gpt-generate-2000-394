T-Rex: I have been thinking, and I have come up with the perfect solution to the problem of my being considered, by others, to be "cute".

T-Rex: I will become the sort of person who says "Cute! Duds!"

T-Rex: I will become as the sort who says "Cute Of Tones".
Duds!
T-Rex: For someone who dismisses the word "tuds" as if it were a real word, that is a pretty significant accomplishment!

Utahraptor: I say we adopt the word "tuds".
T-Rex: Yes!

T-Rex: It is a bit confusing, because you've got this sensation of having been cammed, either by your own words or by others.
Utahraptor: Yeah, that's pretty distracting.
T-Rex: It's bothersome too!

T-Rex: People sometimes talk about me as if I'm a toy, or as if I'm just so great that I somehow "crammed [me] into words".
T-Rex: Sometimes I feel like I'm spending a sweet afternoon in a gentlemen's club!
