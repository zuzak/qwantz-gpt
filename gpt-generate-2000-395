Narrator: "How To Train Your Wife"
T-Rex: I was asked how to train a wife. I was a little surprised, because I was never raised in a home where our first marriage was framed by two opposite-sex married couple.

T-Rex: I was raised by both heterosexuals and gay couples, and I think it's fair that we can all agree that there are far too many open homosexuals?

T-Rex: But that's changing, Dromiceiomimus! We can still fall in love with our spouse!
Dromiceiomimus: Yes! Can you imagine?
T-Rex: It's a SINGLE SEXIARY GAME, and the only thing that can happen is that the game will have brought us to a stalemate. We'll then get to move in together.

Utahraptor: The other possibility is that the game will be played out monogamous, with only one spouse for each player!
T-Rex: That's exciting!

T-Rex: And I think it's fair that we can still form original friendships based on all the similar but distinct characteristics of our shared personality.
Utahraptor: Me too!

T-Rex: If that's the case, then the other possibility is that we go out and WECCP, have kids, and then have other children.
T-Rex: Life's too complicated for that!
