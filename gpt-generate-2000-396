T-Rex: Hands up if you want the Utahraptor to name a character after you!

T-Rex: Name right the person you want to name!

T-Rex: The character would have a great name, it would represent the hero, or at the very least, a flawed but brilliant random actor named Chad. But Chad is flawed. I would actually give T-Rex the benefit of the doubt!!
Dromiceiomimus: I think Chad would be named "Chad".
T-Rex: That's what I'm saying.

Utahraptor: Name right the character's super-weakly-named "Chad"
T-Rex: Not bad!

Utahraptor: Name right the character's premise "A Story About a Man Who Grew Up To Name A Lady. . . Dude Grew Up To Name A Lady."
T-Rex: Okay, good! Okay, good. Okay, good. Hold on.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Chad Sande (whom I will call "Chad") has a story about. . .  "Chad."
T-Rex: Oh NO, NAME RIGHT THE NAME of THAT story is "A Story About A Lady."
T-Rex: That's too bad! I really don't think Chad would name a character after me.
