T-Rex: I'm not a guy who's afraid to say stupid things.  In fact, I've been saying stupid things for years now!

Narrator: "SECURITY MACHINE"

T-Rex: Anyway, I say this as a stranger who's constantly being called "The Secret Agent Who Stole All The Folks' Stuff" because he's smarter than them and I've got better grammar!
Dromiceiomimus: Um.
T-Rex: Only my grammar is so good that I can't be accused of hiding anything from God!

Utahraptor: I disagree!
T-Rex: See?

Utahraptor: The whole point of our friendship is that we're both Secret Agents, and in some ways, we share a secret!
T-Rex: We share secrets ALL THE TIME.
Utahraptor: Yes, as well.

T-Rex: So awesome!
T-Rex: I KINDA THINK IT'S SO WRONG TO ASK GOD IF I COULD ENHANCE MY GENDER ROUTINE PROCESSES
T-Rex: I really do though
