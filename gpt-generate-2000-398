T-Rex: I am a guy who has a singular focus: on painting.

T-Rex: Oh snap, here we are!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus has done some amazing work, so I am very excited to be a part of it.  I also look forward to the rest of my life being the rosiest.
Dromiceiomimus: So what's your current state?
T-Rex: Well frig!

Utahraptor: So what's your current mood, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Sad! I mean, REALLY sad!

Utahraptor: Well, you can't really say that, but in my opinion, "vomit" is a better word.
T-Rex: Really? Really? You're still down with that?
Utahraptor: No I'm down with that! "Vomit" is far better!

T-Rex [[thinking]]: Utahraptor checked herself in the mouth and said "You alright, man?"
T-Rex [[thinking]]: She's right here!
T-Rex [[thinking]]: She's gonna kiss this guy tonight!
T-Rex [[thinking]]: She's gonna kiss him whenever!
T-Rex [[thinking]]: She's gonna kiss me now!
