T-Rex: I have come up with a way to become immortal! It's so simple, in fact, that it can be done in a way that is EASY for anyone to do!

T-Rex: Simply say you'd like to be immortal, but you don't know anyone who can do that job!

T-Rex: Congratulations! You are now at the peak of your wit and you have won the argument! You have won the challenge. Now, you may say, "What have I done with...?" but you can't make that sentence now, because everyone understands now. You may now say, "I have won the argument; you have won the person of my birth!"

Utahraptor: But you don't win the argument!
T-Rex: But!!

T-Rex: You may now further enter into uniting all the disparate viewpoints to form a single narrative: that is, "The Case Against Superman/Batman".
Utahraptor: I won't do that.
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I will!
Utahraptor: Now, I will take the lead!

Narrator: Soon...
T-Rex: Man, Superman sucks! Nobody told him
