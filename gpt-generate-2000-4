T-Rex: I'm not going to lie: I have a lot of friends. But I'm talking about friends here, right in the diary!

T-Rex: It's a fact that we're not friends anymore.

T-Rex: I remember going through my life in the diary and seeing that I never got married.  I remember saying "Dear diary, I'm SO GLAD I don't see anyone missing!"  and then I remembered that feeling, and I remember feeling even more Glad I Tried To Write Myself A Star-Spangled Banner.
Dromiceiomimus: And then?
T-Rex: And then I remember feeling even MORE Star-Spangled as the pages of this future's most gorgeous diary were suddenly punctuated by pages punctuating by "Friggin' pages".

Utahraptor: But it's not just pages!
T-Rex: Yes.

T-Rex: I think what makes this so special is how full this diary just got.  I think diaryis, the entire history of our lives, right here, right now.
Utahraptor: It's amazing how little you care about getting old or anything!
T-Rex: I know!  I know!

T-Rex: I really do!  I really really do.  I think that this entire time and this diary could give you a glimpse into the heart of man.
T-Rex: It's a glimpse into the heart of man, Utahraptor.
