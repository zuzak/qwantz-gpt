T-Rex: After the success of my erotic fiction, I plan on starting a second-person narrative.  My protagonist is a waitress who became famous because of her sexy stories!

T-Rex: First, she saves a friend's sandwich from the wrong guy.

T-Rex: Then she tells him she loves him and he's cool with her.  Then he becomes her personal best friend and she identifies as female.   
T-Rex: DONE.

Utahraptor: But then what happens?
T-Rex: The book was never published?

T-Rex: Maybe my story takes place on a world where everyone knows they're the only one who identifies as female.  And it doesn't matter if either person knows the other's secret identities!  I don't need a book that talks about being sad!
Utahraptor: I was hoping for more "alternate-universe" stories.
T-Rex: I guess I didn't mind that you were bringing this to my attention, my friend!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: So, after years of silence, I've finally said enough is enough!  I want alternate universes! Alternate MEANING.
T-Rex: Alternate lifetimes!
