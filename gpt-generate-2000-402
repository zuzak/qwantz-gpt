T-Rex:  Aw crap!  Is it Windows 8 or something?  It's not like I can run Windows 8 on my machine.  I'll get a new machine running on my current generation!

T-Rex:  I hate to be the one to tell everyone what's wrong with my computer, but I can at least promise that after several CPU freezes later (assuming I ever open them up) I'm going to get a new computer!

T-Rex:  And then, after a few hours of play a game, I'm going to figure out how to win these CPU freezes by opening up some games!
Dromiceiomimus:  I already have a game installed.
T-Rex:  Of course!!  I stare at my own computer blankly, but stare at some games I play.
T-Rex:  They're like regular MinecA games in that they're like, "one who can read about the world and put words to that" - no, wait, yes, I can do that.  And when they're over, everyone has to pay the winner $500!

Utahraptor:  But are you really going to play those games??
T-Rex:  Of course not!

T-Rex:  They're like... endless?
T-Rex:  I'm not sure what I'm doing here!  I don't think I'm going to enjoy them.
Utahraptor:  You've won the game, but it seems the game is worth $500.
T-Rex:  Yeah, but why would I??

T-Rex:  Wow, the game's really boring, isn't it??  Aren't there any real interesting genres on the planet, other than Western?
Utahraptor:  I'm not sure there are, in fact, any.
T-Rex:  Wow, that's a great answer!  Why do you think we need a game where we have to follow a dude who writes "oh no" all the time??

T-Rex:  I know, it is so interesting!
