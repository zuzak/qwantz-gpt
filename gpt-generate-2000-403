T-Rex:  I have come up with the ultimate way to be totally invisible!

T-Rex:  You'll be able to stare at things for hours if you really want to - oh my God!  Forget it, man!

T-Rex:  Instead of trying to look anything in the arm or the other arm, you could totally look at things in the other arm! Observe my own passive aggressive behavior!
Dromiceiomimus: ...Including in the Other Arm?
T-Rex:  Um...I mean, one arm up, and my other arm is down the side.
T-Rex:  I'm not supposed to try and look ANYWHERE else!

Utahraptor:  See what you've done, friend?
T-Rex:  Two separate ways to look at things!

T-Rex:  Instead of looking at things in the other arm, instead I'm looking at things in the other arm, and you see what you were looking at.
Utahraptor:  Oh!  Wow!
T-Rex:  Wow!

Narrator:  Shortly:
T-Rex:  Hey, I have some surprising news!
T-Rex:  Hey, good news: your left arm is a machine!
