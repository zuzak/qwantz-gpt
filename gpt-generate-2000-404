T-Rex: The question this time: who would win the Nobel Prize for Best Translated Book Title!

T-Rex: Everyone!

T-Rex: You get to decide who gets the prize! The winner gets the right to demand that the entire publishing industry be embarrassed and to demand that every bestselling book title be renamed to "Book Number One: The Price Is Right".
Dromiceiomimus: This seems pretty arbitrary, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I'm afraid so!

T-Rex: The prize is a unique and important one awarded by some objective and impartial third party. It's also not awarded to judges! 
Utahraptor: Really?

T-Rex: Yep!  The prize is only given to "speculators" who "inquire" about the price of something when the product or service is advertised as "a good deal"? 
Utahraptor: Really?  Of course!
T-Rex: ...Um, maybe??

Narrator: LATER:
Book Seller: I CAN HELP YOU OUT:

Book Seller: That's the best part, my friend!
Book Seller: Wait, what
