T-Rex: What a busy day, everyone!  I've been late for a function, and I'm afraid that I'm about to be asked to move somewhere else!

T-Rex: So, I'm going to call the police!

T-Rex: It's a simple matter of... failing to return to my home base today, when I might have other business to attend to?
T-Rex: It's a serious concern, as I am currently the sole occupant of the home!
T-Rex: I accept no responsibility or liability as a human being!

Utahraptor: T-Rex, I totally understand you're a human being, and I'm really glad you decided to go through this with being a human being.

T-Rex: But, in conclusion, I feel it'd be in the best interest of our friendship to discuss this matter with you at length.
Utahraptor: T-Rex - well, I guess it's never too late to move!
T-Rex: I guess it's never too late to move!
