T-Rex: I have the best idea for a Batman story. It's called "House." And it's a vigilante-sexy family gets involved and tries to save their friend! BUT, things get super interesting when the titular Batman is involved, and he veers dangerously close to murder!

T-Rex: Then the mystery gets even more interesting!

T-Rex: And it veers wildly from there, allowing the reader (and, in doing so, our imagination) more access to the story. So, Batman's (OR Robin's) house is now a fantastical rendition of reality, complete with wild flora and fauna, subterranean catacombs, and eldritch curses. It's awesome.
T-Rex: And then the story ends!

Utahraptor: So it's a version of real life that has changed?
T-Rex: Yes! Yes, and it's DEFINITELY the best place on the planet for awesome to start.

T-Rex: But the moral of the story is... don't stop until you realize this: If you're going to stop being a Batman, you're going to need more Batman.
Utahraptor: I-is that as T-Rex?
T-Rex: I am extending the life of the species I inhabit!
Narrator: THE END
