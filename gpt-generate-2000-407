T-Rex: I have been thinking, and I have come up with the perfect solution to the problem of my being considered, by others, to be "cute".

T-Rex: I will become "cute Adult Plus", and my solution is to become a cinder-block "cuteness", riding the smooth smooth of societal complacency!
T-Rex: It is a rude business model!

Utahraptor: So what are we gonna do about it?
T-Rex: We ARE going to become a society in which "cute" means "cute Well, That's Awesome Too, Anyway".
T-Rex: I will ride the smooth of societal complacency without ever stepping on a single nail.

T-Rex: I will never again be forgiven, perhaps for as little as a few seconds.
T-Rex: My ultimate fate is that of a "Custodian" who will drive a wedge between the monied and the the dispossessed.
T-Rex: My ultimate fate is that of a "Custoy" who will rescue my lonely friend from peril, only he has his own personal implosions.
