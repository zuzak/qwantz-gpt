T-Rex: I've come into possession of several kilograms of gold!

T-Rex: I will treasure this precious metal in the most recent fashion!

T-Rex: Upon inspection, I find myself compelled to exchange some for a more precious metal!  No doubt on account of the course of my outrageous career!
Dromiceiomimus: Gold's hard to find, eh?
T-Rex: It's mine to trade for dollars!

Utahraptor: Wait - what exactly are you arguing?
T-Rex: Gold is something for losers!

T-Rex: It's pretty sweet, you guys!  But, on the other hand, it's not like you could ever beat me.  Dollars are not so great an item.
Utahraptor: Fine!  I'll trade some for dollars!
T-Rex: Dollars are not so great ANSWERS to be chased by a fancied dollars.  Utahraptor, I am selling you some gold!

T-Rex: IT'S LIKE
T-Rex: THAT'S THE FIRST OF ALL KNOWN DISCUSSIONS
