T-Rex: I made some friggin' clothes!
T-Rex: It was pretty flattering, you guys!

T-Rex: I knitted some slippers!
Dromiceiomimus: Did you know, T-Rex, that I'm not married to prove that I'm totally straight?
T-Rex: I woulda le termin' on that!

Utahraptor: So when were you married?
T-Rex: Oh, actually, today!

T-Rex: I was gonna go to the wedding of my own free, and my friend was there too so I could record her comments and make her think things were such a big deal for me.
Utahraptor: I was going to the wedding of my own free, my friend announced.

T-Rex: I was gonna say things like "My man, dollars cannot buy charity" or "I have recently seen large numbers of good people struggling to make ends meet. I am troubled and troubled" and T-Rex was "concerned."
T-Rex: "I was."
T-Rex: "NOT CONVINCED."
