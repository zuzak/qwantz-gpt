T-Rex: A friend of mine has started dating a new woman!

T-Rex: The friend is going to name the whole place "The Friend Who Made The World For Men".  And they're going to name the whole place "The Evil Friend Who Made The World For Women".

T-Rex: They're probably going by "Fellow traveler, traveler, traveler!".
Dromiceiomimus: The name's somewhat hazy, T-Rex, but I presume you're planning a trip to the farthest farthest continent?
T-Rex: No, it's just - weird.  It's weird.
T-Rex: Anyway, the friend is bad-ass.

Utahraptor: So, T-Rex, what happens next?
T-Rex: The friend is... DEAD?

T-Rex: The friend was discovered a few weeks ago, and her body no longer contained any more memories.
T-Rex: [ ] Despite this, the friend is determined to be a different person this time.

T-Rex: She will seek to destroy all reason by developing a clear understanding of her own existence, using all her means at her disposal to ascertain the truth surrounding her sudden death.
T-Rex: Unless...
T-Rex: ...there is a full refund?
