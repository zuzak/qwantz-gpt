Narrator: DIFFERENT WAYS TO END A RELATIONSHIP
Narrator: a comic for dudes and ladies who may be getting turned on by the use of online dating

T-Rex: One way is to register friendships online; other methods, such as sending emails and using real people to talk to online friends, have been used for years!

T-Rex: But that's not ideal. Instead of relying on your internet connection to connect you to real people, start dating someone online now. 
Dromiceiomimus: But then you might end up smushed into a parallel universe where you're not really friends, either!
T-Rex: That sounds like a good idea!

Utahraptor: But then when you meet someone online, you might not know they're you!
T-Rex: That's true!

T-Rex: The cool thing about this idea is that you can get to know people better as a result, thereby making the relationship more likely to survive. 
Utahraptor: And this leads us to the final way to end a relationship: register online friendships.

Narrator: THAT LAST JOB
Narrator: and all our current and future information as "facts", pulled from the darkness of the internet
Narrator: WAIT, THERE'S NO WAY OUT
