T-Rex: I'm not sure if I'm a dude or not. I'm not certain that I'm a dude!

T-Rex: I don't know either either!

T-Rex: I'm not even sure what it's like to be a dude.  Man!  You might have your first kiss, and it's weird and awkward and confusing.  People might think you're not a dude, but if you keep trying, it'll happen in front of a ummm... MONSTER.
T-Rex: It might happen in real life, I guess?
T-Rex: Anyway!  I'm not worried about not having a dude wedding this year.
