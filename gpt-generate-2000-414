T-Rex: Dudes!  Whom do I dislike?  Or at least I don't like very much anymore?  Or at least that seems to be the situation for me right now!

T-Rex: It's not that bad a thing to like someone as a Guiding Hand as I do to dislike someone as a GUIDEFULLY.  As a GUIDE, I am personally responsible for the state of the world as we presently exist!

T-Rex: I will be responsible for LATERING the world as it currently is, as the GUIDE of the community responsible for the flourishing of the World as a whole.
Utahraptor: You're not a "guiding hand"!
T-Rex: I'm - I'm not humbug enough to be a guiding hand.

T-Rex: It's just that - the circumstances surrounding me liking or disliking something are SO INTERESTING!  I'm at a crossroads.
Utahraptor: And it could be for other reasons!
T-Rex: Depressing?  Am I to be the guiding hand for the entire Universe?

T-Rex: MAYBE I just like to imagine all the people in a room with me and them whispering SECRETS of our Story, leading up to when we're REALLY WEIRD?
T-Rex: The best possible intentions for a single person, even if they were JUST SINCE OTHER PEOPLE, cannot possibly be reconciled!
