T-Rex: Wednesday is the best of Fridays!
T-Rex: Whooooo we are!

T-Rex: Whooooo we are!

T-Rex: We are the benevolent guys who just want a quick bite to eat, not like we're going to do anything until the last last second.
Utahraptor: Thursday is actually the freshest Thursday!

T-Rex: It's the freshest Thursday EVER, Utahraptor. As I say, it's THE freshest. It's the freshest. The air is white and stale.
Utahraptor: Friday is actually the freshest Friday, because it's - it's actually - it's actually - Friday.
T-Rex: ...Wait, hold on a second. That's the freshest Friday ever. It's EVEN THE FUTUREmost.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: ...Holy crap. That's the freshest Friday ever. It's EVEN THE FUTUREFUTUREmost.
T-Rex: ...Wait.
T-Rex: Okay. That's the freshest Friday ever. It's EVEN THE FUTUREmost.
