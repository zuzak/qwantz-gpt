T-Rex: I was wondering if there was any way I could make my own immortality blanket!

T-Rex: I've been thinking about it!

T-Rex: I've come up with the blanket idea, and I want my own immortality project. I want my project to make me super great!
Dromiceiomimus: You want my project to make me like people?
T-Rex: YES. No. I want my project to make me want to be immortal too.

Utahraptor: Okay, I'm going to make you a immortality blanket.
T-Rex: Oh yeah?

T-Rex: Just make you stay in eight different reality after you die that's eight different! And when you return, whatever was holding you back might be able to use your blanket to make something better. Maybe you'll find that's EASY.
Utahraptor: Wow.
T-Rex: I know!

Narrator: LATER, AT HOME. . . AND A LITTLE MORE TALKING ABOUT VISION STATION:
T-Rex: So what's the blanket's deal with?
T-Rex: My friend, I am really enjoying myself and my own immortality!
