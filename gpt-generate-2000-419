Narrator: T-REX HAS WRITTEN A STORY ABOUT A DATING
T-Rex: I'm not a historian!  I've got facts! Facts about the past.  Facts about people and places and things that used to be cool and then, well...

T-Rex: ... and then some!

T-Rex: Fine!  Let's do this!  Let's get this started now.
Utahraptor: Okay, but which timeline do you choose?
T-Rex: I choose the UNSETTLING!

T-Rex: The first timeline is one in which people mostly died in ships that had been refit, which is extremely depressing.  The second timeline is one where a lot of ships were built, which is even more depressing.
Utahraptor: Okay, let's start with 2025!
T-Rex: Okay!

T-Rex: Then let's go further in that timeline and even go further back in time to ensure my own good living now.
Utahraptor: Then let's ensure you include things like "The year 2025: pretty okay! Just a-ok, that. Or the year 1990: pretty okay."
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: Okay.  I'm going to focus more on the things that have motivated me to the best of my ability.
