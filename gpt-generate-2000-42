Narrator: "THE STORY OF A ROBIN"
T-Rex: Robin Cook's story begins in a library!

T-Rex: The library has a nice collection of old books; one reads "HOW TO LIVE A MEANINGFUL LIFE", "ON AND BACK, 'FORESHADEN'", and "IT IS MANDATORY, BY THE WAY, OKAY"?
T-Rex: These, Robin adds, "are the names of respectable names: Sir, C.S. A. M. has respectable lives."
T-Rex: A few minutes later, the library credits Robin with "having a productive conversation", and the library's friendly Robin adds, "YOUR HONESTY: a pleasant evening in a library!"

Utahraptor: And then the credits roll, T-Rex!
T-Rex: A "pleasant evening in a library" is a nice little line, and then the credits roll.

T-Rex: It's one thing to say your name was "Sir, or at least somewhat more accurately Sir, or I guess more precisely Sir, C.S.A." but to do something quite different?
Utahraptor: Exactly!
T-Rex: THE END.

T-Rex: Oh, and one last time to save face, T-Rex has some strange dreams where he's running around with broken glass; what's this, a twist? Is he acting out of FRIGGIN' THESE dreams?
T-Rex: I think he's behaving OUT OF FRIGGIN' TODAY, Utahraptor!!
