T-Rex: You can think of any number of things to say, but what really counts is "Well, this is barely distinguishable from an ordinary sentence".

T-Rex: From now on, any valid thought will be treated as though it came from the audience!

T-Rex: People will enjoy a brief summary of the facts before they are said, while those in the know will assume that any conclusion is implied.
Dromiceiomimus: Oh!
T-Rex: Doesn't that sound a little... interesting?

Utahraptor: Um, what does it sound like?
T-Rex: What do you mean?

Utahraptor: Anything that sounds like it came from the audience!
T-Rex: Anything that sounds like I said it will! It will be fascinating.
Utahraptor: Oh my gosh. I would actually say... "Interestingly enough, everyone talked about this for a long time."
T-Rex: "Interestingly enough, everyone talked about this for a long time too!" OH SNAP.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I just made a fantastic discovery that I will share with you tonight: the ancient Greeks listened to music orally for thousands of years and found unexpected rhythm and cadence combinations that were, in fact, Western. It's amazing.
T-Rex: I know, right?
T-Rex: It's the stuff of cultural invention
