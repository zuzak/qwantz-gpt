T-Rex: I have a friend who was born in the year 1837, and who died in the year 1882.  This is a very unusual event, and the exact cause of death is not known.  The only records that exist are those recorded by witnesses, usually in and about the capital city of New York City!

T-Rex: Anyway!

T-Rex: The only records that exist are those recorded by anonymous, third-party sources, who have no record of being there!
Dromiceiomimus: That's true.  That's history!  I don't know why you're interested in hearing more about this, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's history, Dromiceiomimus.  You know history.

Utahraptor: Well, I was only speculating, and there's only one record that's current, and all we've got is record BOOKS.
T-Rex: Aw, that's weird!

T-Rex: You know what's also weird?  There's been no records of historical events that interest us, and we're like, scratch that, what happened to the record that we can read about?  no records at all.  Tada in-universe chronicles, hardback.
Utahraptor: Like hardback with alternate universe alternate universe cover art?
T-Rex: TOTALLY IN-UNIVERSE!!
