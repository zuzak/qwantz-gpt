Dromiceiomimus: I think not!
T-Rex: We do it all the time!

Utahraptor: Have we become cyborgists?
T-Rex: Not literally!

T-Rex: We're hobbyists, you know?  We're not going to the movies!  We'll just go to the bookstore and think "man, this book is so great, I am almost certain I won't ever die"!
Utahraptor: Are we at leastathetically modern, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Oh man!  If I were to describe to you my new book... well, it starts with "bookers" and goes on to detail its out-of-copyright nature??
