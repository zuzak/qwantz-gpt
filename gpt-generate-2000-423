T-Rex: I have a friend who decided that "practice being right in front of a camera is worth a thousand bucks", and decided to tell you all about him. Now I know he's an important person in our lives and it's worth a thousand dollars.

T-Rex: I SERIOUSLY FORGOT TO GET MY FRIENDS INTO MY ARRIVALS ARRIVALS

T-Rex: I guess my ultimate social responsibility is to let my friends know what I think, while keeping in regular touch with them on a regular basis. I gotta go drop some stuff without even looking right now!!
Dromiceiomimus: You can't just drop stuff at your house.
T-Rex: WELL I CAN ASSURE SOMEONE THIS IS NOT A REASONABLE FAULT AND I WILL NOT BE SHENNY

Utahraptor: I thought maybe the only reason your friends are making out is you're not wearing a shirt that says "we need to get naked in public" and there's a shirt on the front of your sweater that says "WE NEED TO GET UNWIDDED".
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yeah. And I guess that's why nobody wants to buy my sweater.
T-Rex: They're going to find something else!
T-Rex: KNOWN
