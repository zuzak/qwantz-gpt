T-Rex: The best way to learn about science is to pay attention to what people do! If I'm answering a question by mistake, I'm going to pay attention to what they do!

T-Rex: Attention: totally would be wise for doing that?

T-Rex: If I'm really serious about this, I'm going to pay attention to what my friends do, and I'm going to try to make sure that they're careful with what they do, okay? I'm going to pay attention to what my friends say when they hear the same thing, and I'm going to try to make sure that they're all polite and understanding.

Utahraptor: I agree TAUGHTY, but you're totally ignoring the consciousness around you.
T-Rex: I disagree!!

T-Rex: I'd say that's to say I try to make sure that my friends know what my favourite suffix are when they hear me talking about science stuff!
Utahraptor: Well
T-Rex: But how?
Utahraptor: By... Noticing the Consciousness-Only World!

T-Rex: Oh yeah? Well here's some advice, hitting "T" when talking about consciousness:
T-Rex: Don't be afraid to use the plural! Also, don't use the adjective "elite".
