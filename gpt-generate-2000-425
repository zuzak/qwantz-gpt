T-Rex: Shoot!

T-Rex: It's time for some epitaph-sizing!

T-Rex: "So hey, time travellers, if you go back in time to visit a sick friend of a friend, you'll get a smooch".
Dromiceiomimus: "I wonder, are you not punching back harder now that my body has become too old? Perhaps as my 'old friend'?", you ask?
T-Rex: I am indeed!

Utahraptor: I don't see why you're running so fast!
T-Rex: Why not?

Utahraptor: You're older, you understand, and you seem more interested in the present moment.  So rather than going back in time, I'll just go back to the past!
T-Rex: That's not how my friendship works!
Utahraptor: T-That's not how my friendship works!

Narrator: THAT EVENING...
T-Rex: Excuse me, sir! Would you like to come over for a bite?
Person: Sir! Can I come over for a bite to... the movie P.M.?
T-Rex: I... guess not!
