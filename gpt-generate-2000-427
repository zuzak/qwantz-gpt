T-Rex: Apollo 11 visits the moon - the REAL test!

T-Rex: They land on the WELL-SAVED moon - which, INCIDENTALLY, were not on the moon!

T-Rex: But they run into some problem lifecycles, which is true. The Soviets are planning to build a robot body on the moon, which could give the Americans a respite from the maelstrom of spaceflight coming to an end.
Dromiceiomimus: Robot bodies could be used as abominable... marks of distinction.
T-Rex: ...Okay.

Utahraptor: And so this is why we call them "weights and measures"?
T-Rex: No, heavens.

T-Rex: You're just going to call them "weights and measures" because the Soviets won't let the Americans measure their own. And also because most of us don't even know how to best use our measure! hearts!
Utahraptor: ...Okay.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE PAST:
T-Rex: Excuse me, sir, and half a brie and a colt?
Sir: Oh yes! Also, sir forgot to put in his email address.
T-Rex: I will now apologize for forgetting your email address!!
