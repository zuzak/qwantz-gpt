T-Rex: When I was a child I used to go and sit on a little island by the river. There I would go and float down to the water's edge, and then, as if to reassure you, I would splash into the water.
T-Rex: Whoops! Turns out it's still happening!

T-Rex: We have to do it again when I'm old, okay? 

Dromiceiomimus: I - I think we have to do it every time, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Okay, fine. 
T-Rex: Okay, fine. 

Utahraptor: I suggest we do it every time, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Awesome!

Utahraptor:  ...Okay. 
T-Rex: Awesome. 
Utahraptor:  Wow. 
T-Rex: Awesome. 
T-Rex: Awesome. 
T-Rex: Awesome. 
T-Rex: Awesome. 
T-Rex: Awesome. 
T-Rex: Awesome. 
T-Rex: I think it might be awkward to stand there and think, that's all!
