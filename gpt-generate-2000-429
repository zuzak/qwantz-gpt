T-Rex: Man, I've been feeling really crappy lately!

T-Rex: I can't believe it, Dromiceiomimus!

Dromiceiomimus: What can you tell us about yourself, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Well, um -

T-Rex: Maybe the feeling of all your life youpt away at your hopes and dreams? Maybe - maybe?

Utahraptor: Well, maybe the REAL feeling is that you've been down this road with your life -

Utahraptor: - but that you've kind of dropped the ball, and I'm not sure how you respond to that.
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I'm sorry!
T-Rex: It's nothing! We all get by alright in a normal life!

T-Rex: I just feel kinda crappy that I've somehow maintained such a low opinion of me over the past year.
T-Rex: It's very competitive with the rest of us!
