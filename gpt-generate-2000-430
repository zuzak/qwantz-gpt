T-Rex: If I said "Hey, here's a great way to make you feel better!" I would say "Feeling better" and only then do I follow.

T-Rex: Follow a few simple comfort foods.

T-Rex: For example, some vegetables might appeal to me most like grains of rice, while others might appeal especially to people who are not my friends.
Dromiceiomimus: These foods might make you feel better?
T-Rex: Excellent! Perhaps a little grain-free chocolate?

Utahraptor: Here are some grain-free chocolate that you might enjoy as a dessert!
T-Rex: Yes!

T-Rex: They may well be the Eating Well Gold standard. At least for me!
Utahraptor: They may well be the eating standard.
T-Rex: I'm not!
T-Rex: They may well be the eating standard.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hello Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: I'm T-Rex from the future!
T-Rex: Now I'm sorry I've been a bit snippy to you in the past few days, but I promise I won't barge into your computer in search of a mobile.
T-Rex: Okay!
T-Rex: Okay
T-Rex: This is a web card
