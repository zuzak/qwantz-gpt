T-Rex: Dudes!  Today is the day I go up on stage and insult everyone with my hilarious joke that "I've got arms"!

T-Rex: I'm going to make SNL stars out of myself!

T-Rex: So, I'm going to start insulting people by puttinging them in clown clothes!  And I'm going to make SNL stars of working people who mistreat their patients!  I'm going to make working people's doctors sub in to "let's put a little flour in the water and let's treat them with our promises of future medical care."
T-Rex: Hah!  I think I'm really going to go all out.

Utahraptor: You're not going to do this?
T-Rex: Nope!

Utahraptor: You can do this either way!  You can do this by putting me somewhere interesting, by changing the subject, and then when I get home, I'll get to examine your arm.
T-Rex: You don't understand!  You've just had a great time making jokes about my friendship with my doctor, but you've somehow missed something in real life.

T-Rex: You're worried that doctors are not as into their patients as you are.  They're more into their patient-patient relationship!
T-Rex: Hah!
T-Rex: [[Thinking]]
