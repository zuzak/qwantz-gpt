T-Rex: I have received complaints. Apparently I can be a difficult person to direct!

T-Rex: Apparently!

T-Rex: Apparently I can be a difficult person to direct, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: I have received complaints.
T-Rex: Apparently I CAN be difficult persons to direct, T-Rex!

Utahraptor: I have received complaints.
T-Rex: How?

Utahraptor: I have had complaints about people on the basis of their nature, while others have claimed they have been touched by someone else. It's ridiculous!
T-Rex: Whistle blowers!
Utahraptor: Well, I'll say it: if there was a complaint forum for complaint making, I think I'd be in business to get started on such a complaint forum!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I am back in business, ladies and gentlemen!
T-Rex: I will start there!
