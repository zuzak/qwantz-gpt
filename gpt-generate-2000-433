Narrator: T-REX IN: "WRAPPING WITH HIS HATS"
T-Rex: I'm going to stop whatever I'm doing to you, Dromiceiomimus!

T-Rex: I'm just going to say that I find the process a little repetitive.

T-Rex: But that doesn't mean, Dromiceiomimus! That I'M not tired of jerks friggin' hoeing and/or.  We can do better.
Dromiceiomimus: But I think sometimes, when you're jerkin' it, you're forgetting that maybe you shouldn't be so jerky.
T-Rex: Maybe!

Utahraptor: Still not jerky?
T-Rex: Still jerkin' it, Utahraptor!

T-Rex: Well, I'm going to start thinking about what we can do to improve this, then. MAYBE, I, um -
Utahraptor: "Some other time"?
T-Rex: No, because you're now forgetting how I used to be cool as well.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Today, I apologize in advance for omitting any details! I would also like to apologize again in writing, for now ENTIRELY FOR SURE."
T-Rex: "Some other time!"
T-Rex: Hehe!
T-Rex: That wasn't even entirely true
