T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate terrible idea.  There's a robot suit! And he's smart!

T-Rex: Nobody can beat him!

T-Rex: So nobody has to defeat him for me to be good! The only thing I've been able to do is sneak up behind the group and suck in a droppings can.  Then I'll just be able to shoot down and say "Who's going to be the most SADEST??"  The audience will applaud!
Dromiceiomimus: But then how do we know who's super sad?
T-Rex: That's - you know? Um, STEEFY?

Utahraptor: The CIA?
T-Rex: That's - well, that's a great robot, but it's not the CIA.  They're the blinds, and everybody can look in but the blinds.  We all look in but the blinds don't close very close.
Utahraptor: Ah.

T-Rex: If I were blind, I could see the world in 3D, but that would be weird. The blinds would cover a 3D illusion, and then the figment of a robot takes over and says "Everyone looks in the cartoon, but I'm sure everyone will look in the future. '"
T-Rex: Everyone looks in the future.  I want you to look in the cartoon, but you probably won't.
