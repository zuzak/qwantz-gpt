T-Rex: Okay now that we've all learnt about friendship, let's get started on friendship...

T-Rex: ...with some EDUCATION awarded to contestants of Jeopardy.

Dromiceiomimus: So we'll play "Game Changers", T-Rex.
T-Rex: No, that's a terrible thing. You could play "Game Changers and Don't Tell Me Everything", Don't Tell Me Everything. It would be played with Other Person As "Game Changers" would play Other Game Changers, which could be anything.
T-Rex: Um.
T-Rex: "Game Changers involving anonymity, of course."

Utahraptor: The idea of a game where other people know each other is, um, more interesting than a real game.

T-Rex: "Game Changers featuring anonymity" has an eerily familiar feel to it, like you're walking into a haunted mansion and there's a cheezed-off grocery-store interior just before you see door lids open and you glance up -

T-Rex: It's funny, because the other cheezed-off store is just before the door closes and you're still walking through, face down, on the grass.
T-Rex: That was funny, back. 
T-Rex: Back to reality.
