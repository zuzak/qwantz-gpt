T-Rex: Oh my god I have to get my own TV show!

T-Rex: It's going to be terrible!

T-Rex: It's going to be, "How do bad TV stories turn to TV great?" It will also be terrible. It will be TOWELS. People will be T-Rex carrying boxes of - uh, - crap. "T-Rex" is HILARIOUS. People will be T-Rex being TOWELS.
T-Rex: People will be T-Rex.

Utahraptor: You want a TV show about a TV show? "Burner"?
T-Rex: I do not!

T-Rex: I have considered the matter and have concluded that the show needs some "in" element. It needs a "how do TV shows get away from their familiar but also cool production values" show.
Utahraptor: You want a show about a TV show? "Arrow"?
T-Rex: I do not have that idea in mind Arrow will Star in this episode.

LATER: "SIBLAT" STARTS IN FIRST FRONT OF 'AVENGED TRADING'
T-Rex: I need to punch this house!
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: It'll be so great
