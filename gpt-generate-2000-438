T-Rex: I had the strangest dream last night...

T-Rex: It was crazy!

T-Rex: There was this woman in the audience that I had no reason to believe existed, and then she said that she'd be bringing in a television personality, and that personality would be making fun of her own excellent point of view!
Dromiceiomimus: Wow!

T-Rex: Well, I guess this is kind of a weird ending...
Utahraptor: To be fair, T-Rex, it does end with you, the woman, being sexually assaulted by an extremely drunk guy!

T-Rex: The alcohol in my system shot up to the point where I was no longer prepared for sexual contact. It was very erotic. I had only a few drinks, but by the end, most of the patrons were shouting profanities at each other!
Utahraptor: That's pretty amazing.

Narrator: LATER:
TV Personality: T-REX I WAS WRONG AND OUR POINT OF CONVERSATION WAS NOT EMAIL
T-Rex: Aw man, nevermind!
T-Rex: Oh my gosh, what the heck, huh?
T-Rex: I'll tell you what's going to be great down south.
