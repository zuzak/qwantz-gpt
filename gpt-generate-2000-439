Narrator: HIDDEN PROMISE COMICS
T-Rex: Everyone knows that the secret to happiness is eating healthy!

T-Rex: But what everyone doesn't realize is that smoking can increase the risk of heart disease AND disease by the millions!

T-Rex: It's especially pronounced when you consume alcohol!  It's also known as 'fast-food nicotine delivery system' and it acts like a sucky bike to the grocery store.  Don't even get me started on the EDIBLE.  It's cheap, easy, AND effective!

Utahraptor: You mean you ACTUALLY know the potential of smoking?
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: I know that when kids are shown a video of a car accelerating, I'll watch them explain that's who gets to decide what happens in the car when they bring it smokeless products from smokeless technology into the house.  I'll swallow the product, too, just so that they don't get turned off in the smoker's arm.  This, my friends, is the power of smokeless technology!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: My friends, I have the perfect solution to be effective at reducing the temperature of my hand... of reducing the possibilities for suffering!
T-Rex: ... at the hands of those who can't see the value in a peaceful, sustainable and just world!
