T-Rex: I am a guy who has a lot of friends, but who still thinks a lot of things that other people think a guy who dresses up as a woman and speaks in all sorts of strange and unfamiliar languages.

T-Rex: Guys! I am an EVEN MORE AWESOME GUY!

T-Rex: So the thing is, if a woman really wants a male relative to talk to her, then she's probably doing that irresponsibly and without due process, and without due process is totally set! A man speaking the English language isn't going to solve all her problems.
Dromiceiomimus: That's true! And if she's a woman, then she's a walking, talking dinosaur, and any male relative she'll talk to will probably be mad at her.
T-Rex: Well, um, it's not that complicated...

Utahraptor: Yeah, just ask them about it!
T-Rex: Okay! My question is, how often do they talk about it?

Utahraptor: How often do they talk about it? What's their talking point? What do they want to talk about?
T-Rex: WHAT?  No, I don't!  They're CIVILIZATION GIRLFRIEND.

T-Rex: They just don't want to talk about it because it's their FIRST CIVILIZATION.  I don't want to hear about their adventures through the terraforming and now I'm not making that happen for me.  I'm not going to be a circus freak, I'm not going to be a sassy dinosaur.
Utahraptor: Okay!
T-Rex: Then I'm done for good!
