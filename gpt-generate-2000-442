T-Rex: Okay, so I'd like to have a child. I'd like to have a fine motor, therefore a politician.

T-Rex: However, given my predilections, I cannot simultaneously have a fine motor and be a fine politician.

T-Rex: Therefore, the gross negligence standard is to be applied to the sole purpose of raising a child!
Dromiceiomimus: That's a fine motor, T-Rex.
T-Rex: A fine motor! Therefore, the gross negligence standard is to be applied to the sole purpose of raising a child!

Utahraptor: Well, I'm confused!
T-Rex: I'm confused!

Utahraptor: Well, you're here to raise a fine motor, not raise a child!
T-Rex: Hmm...

T-Rex: Therefore, the gross negligence standard is to be applied to the entire universe, not just the parts that are obviously causing the problems!
T-Rex: Hmm...
T-Rex: Therefore, the universe is to be observed as a whole as a fine motor!
