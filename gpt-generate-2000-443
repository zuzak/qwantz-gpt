T-Rex: Beethoven wrote some haunting symphonies, and then he died and nobody cared because he was gone! But STILL, there are some amazing works of art that remain untold, undiscovered!

T-Rex: These include his beautiful and equally amazing works of painting, sculpture, and MAKEUP!

T-Rex: Each of these art forms is unique and must be studied, described, and understood by future artists. Future artists must treasure this amazing knowledge and strive to create art that celebrates their art's completion!
Dromiceiomimus: They must?
T-Rex: THEY MUST.

Utahraptor: So artists must strive to produce art that celebrates their art's completion?
T-Rex: NOT AT ALL.

T-Rex: Rather, they must strive to produce art that celebrates our art's completion!
Utahraptor: Amazing!
T-Rex: I know! It's very personal with me and for sure!

T-Rex: BUT, as an artist, I have POWER. I can create art that HAPPENS to have something truly eternal, that truly appeals to today's youth!
T-Rex: I'm so into that!!
