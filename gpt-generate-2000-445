T-Rex: I've decided that I will become a scientist dinosaur.  I will start a lab.  I will work on things that dinosaurs aren't designed to do.  I will finally have invented a scientific name for some of the more central questions in dinosauria!

T-Rex: I call this project, "T-Rex's House."

T-Rex: I will now become a scientist dinosaur, and by "I" I mean "I'M a scientist dinosaur."
Dromiceiomimus: You'll live in a house?
T-Rex: Indeed I will!  My sister will live in a house, and I'll be a scientist dinosaur.

Utahraptor: You'll also create and support the very large, life-sustaining dinosaurs you're about to live in.
T-Rex: Hello?

Utahraptor: Yes.  I expect this endeavour to take you from the point of view of a single, unmarried, male dinosaur into the realm of more fundamental questions in dinosauria.
T-Rex: Yes.  This is true... of me.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Professor, I am Dr. Frankenstein!  I can create my own flesh and blood creatures, or I can give you this, my friend, the name of "T-Rex: The True Scary Movie"!
Utahraptor: ...We'll see about THAT.
T-Rex: ...Yes.  I believe that will be my final installment.  The premise has not changed.
