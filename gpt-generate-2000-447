T-Rex:  Dear recipient of this comic:  One second ago, I sent you a profoundly creepy email.

T-Rex:  Now you know why I said it.

T-Rex:  The sender is troubled.  She knows there is a sinister purpose to everything:  revenge.  And right now she's deducing her own destiny as a consequence!
Dromiceiomimus:  Why are you troubled?
T-Rex:  She knows.  And she knows -
T-Rex:  ...Because she likes me!

Utahraptor:  Well, I meant what I said about... revenge?
T-Rex:  FINE.

T-Rex:  The sender wishes she were less troubled.
Utahraptor:  What does she say?
T-Rex:  She whispers "pooty poot" to every email I ever receive.

T-Rex:  "Pooty poot" is how -
T-Rex:    her name is.
T-Rex:   And yes, my photograph is slutty poot.
