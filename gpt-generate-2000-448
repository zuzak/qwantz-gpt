T-Rex: I have discovered that I have the ability to shift the states of my body in response to events!  The point is that this can alter the way I am perceived, and can even the way I am around the world!

T-Rex: For example: a woman will be able to react to a challenge with an understandable reaction, while a man paralyzed with the instinct to step out onto a clear day can react to a punch of surprise!  This allows me to have far more of a impact than I ever have before!

Utahraptor: This seems a little too much for women, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I know!

T-Rex: But I can still impact on the heart, if I so chose. And I will, with my unpredictable and unpredictable muscles!
Utahraptor: Oh.
T-Rex: Oh.

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Excuse me, sir, have I impact-phrases in the paper I'm writing?
Sir: I represent the limits of my career!
