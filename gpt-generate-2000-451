T-Rex: God, I'm terrible at our friendship similes.
God: UM PHEW
God: LISTEN T-REX I'M GREAT AT THINKING THUS SENTENCE ONLY LET ME ASK YOU
God: SO HERE'S THE THING

God: MY FRIEND
God: CAN TELL YOU WHAT TO THINK
T-Rex: Oh, perfect. Well, I'm going to try!

God: SEE THING
T-Rex: Oh, a diamond. A thousand years in the future, God3 will meet a brilliant young woman named Samantha who can read more Spider-Man fan fiction than God will humanly be able to. Together they will take on the most powerful superhero to ever grace the face of Space - and the whole thing will be ruined.

God: I CAN DO THIS
T-Rex: God will be so angry!!

T-Rex: I'm not sure how I'm going to pull this off!
Utahraptor: What are you doing?

T-Rex: I'm writing a book about it. God will be 3 times more angry than me, and then the other characters are going to be like, "You know what? We don't need this to ends justify" and I'm not sure how I'm going to pull this off.
Utahraptor: I don't think you've pulled it off either.
T-Rex: "You know what?"

God: OH MAN I WAS GONNA USE THE PEN-AFTER-VOCABULAR RENDERING
God: THAT'S JUST HOW WE'VE DONE OUR TALK
T-Rex: God!!
God: AW AREN'T THAT SURE HUH
