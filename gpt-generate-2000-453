T-Rex: I've been thinking, and I've come up with a solution to the problem of our dividing line!

T-Rex: A solution that...remains our entire line of communication searingly non-trivial while simultaneously robbing the average Joe of his $kgps!

T-Rex: The razor-sharp "and" between sentences is now cleaner and less sweary. It also happens to be Girl Power word form, which explains why we all seem to be suddenly convinced "having intercourse" is the answer to our #1 problem.
Dromiceiomimus: I suppose.
T-Rex: Also, I'M not the one who's "having intercourse"!

Utahraptor: It's "having sex"!
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: But the point is, our dividing line isn't revolving around Joe. It's heloting towards the other end!
Utahraptor: Oh. Joe's problem is he doesn't have a communication system that's open to his use.
T-Rex: NO T-REX, THE ESSENTIAL FACTS ARE ALL ALREADY FAILED. THE ONLY ACQUIRED COMMUNICTS ARE NUMBERS, AWKWARD QUESTIONS OF ANTS AND AWKWARDNESS.

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: I said, we're all "orphaned" here! Life just isn't for us.
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: ...Hey, how are you guys doing?
