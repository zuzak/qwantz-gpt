T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate way to be totally alone while having the greatest impact on the world! Say whaaaat?

T-Rex: Impact unknowable!

T-Rex: Hence whaaaat!
T-Rex:Therefore, whaaaat!
T-Rex:Therefore, whaaaat!
T-Rex:Therefore, whaaaat!
T-Rex:Therefore, whaaaat!

Utahraptor: Impact lesson proportional, assumable only to the measure of someone's impact!
T-Rex: Precisely!

Utahraptor: But can we express it in terms of energy consumed, and not as a percentage?
T-Rex: No, clearly we consume the energy of what is physically needed, and not as a percentage.
