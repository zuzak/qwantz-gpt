T-Rex: There's all this past me, all this time and all this sudden I'm DYING.

T-Rex: I'm going to wake up and I'm going to say "Oh my God, what a sick world it is!"

T-Rex: It's all - 
T-Rex: all the things I've wanted to for so long; this is no time to finally meet someone who truly wants to take that next logical step. I'm going to leave the diary open and see what's going on.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm leaving the diary open, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Why are you opening it?

Utahraptor: You're going to question my sanity?
T-Rex: Yeah, I'm going to question my sanity!

T-Rex: Okay, you're going to question my sanity too, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: Well then, I'm leaving!
T-Rex: Why?! WHY?!

T-Rex: Why are you stomping on my house just now?
T-Rex: Why are you stomping on my mom?
T-Rex: Why are you abandoning a child that you love?
