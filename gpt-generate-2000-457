T-Rex: I'm not sure if I've ever experienced the purest expression of the soul, which is saying "This concludes the funlong I've-had-a-sex-together-with-you adventure in which I was, um, Enemies"?  I'm NOT even certain I've ever experienced the purest expression of the soul.

T-Rex: I'm going to pretend!

Dromiceiomimus: Um, okay, but what if you experienced it differently?
T-Rex: I'm - I'm going to make up my own adventure!

Utahraptor: What's going on, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I'm out of town!

T-Rex: But I have the details!
Utahraptor: Okay, let's go tell a story!
T-Rex: It'll be fantastic! People will get the idea of running away from home; homes will fall into chaos; and civilization will collapse.

T-Rex: I'm PRETTY SURE that if I'm feeling particularly awesome, just tell everyone.
T-Rex: Just let me know what you think so that I can come up with a solution!
