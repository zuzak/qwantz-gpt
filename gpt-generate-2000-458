T-Rex: Man, what a jerky guy! I met the guy at the bar last night, and it was great to see him. I told him I wanted to hang out with someone I just met. He replied that he "fully" agrees, and that he "still" desires sex with me.

T-Rex: He went on to clarify that he only wanted sex with me, and that after he's "succeeded" he will "harder" pay for the sex.

T-Rex: The end!
Utahraptor: Wait!

T-Rex: What if he continues to suck? What if he ends up being a jerk who doesn't want to work for profits?
Utahraptor: What if he goes under the name of "Operation Choke point" and does not actually exist? What if he does, but what if he goes by that name anyway?

T-Rex: Utahraptor, please.
T-Rex: It's terrible!
T-Rex: It really is!
