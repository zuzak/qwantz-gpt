T-Rex:  I am a pretty okay dude!  Times are good, right?  Well, I mean... sometimes... good?

T-Rex:  ...Sometimes not?

T-Rex:  It can be rough in life!  Sometimes you can - 
Dromiceiomimus:  Sometimes you can be way down on the list??
T-Rex:  *gasp*

Utahraptor:  So - wait.  Quick!  Am I a BAD MAN?  Is my life not a positive example?
T-Rex:  I'm not!  I mean, I mean, I tried to apply SOMETHING I had learned!

T-Rex:  So, um... here's a plausible defense against being a BAD MAN:  learned?  And now I don't have to worry about making friends again just because I'm bad at it.
Utahraptor:  Finally, let's face it - being good at something can be a...... positive thing?

T-Rex:  HELLO?  I AM BAD AT IT.
T-Rex:  I AM NOT A COMPETITIONAL CULTURAL PERSON
