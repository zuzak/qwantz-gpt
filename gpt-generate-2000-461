T-Rex: I have the best idea for a Batman comic. It's a Batman story about a Batman who has problems.

T-Rex: He solves problems himself!

T-Rex: So his problem is he's a dog who chews up food, but he doesn't know when to eat it. He has to stay in a cot, alone for a while, and then a neighbour comes in to take his food. When he sees someone else doing it, he raises his food level and when he picks up the food, he shoves it right into his own hands. He then chews it up, and then he died.

T-Rex: AHHHH!
Utahraptor: The ending has no relevance!

T-Rex: Huh! What's the use of an ending in a comic where all the issues are solved in one go? I'd like to know the answer to this question, Utahraptor. Please.
Utahraptor: Don't mention it!
T-Rex: Please!!
