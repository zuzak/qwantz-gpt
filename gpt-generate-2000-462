T-Rex: In the 60s and 70s some people used to sex all over the place, but that was before cell phones!

T-Rex: Anyway chicks found them, and soon cell phones were no longer used because they were no longer in use. In the 70s chicks were in fact, having sex with REGRET.

T-Rex: And you're telling me the story of how you and your friends ended up kissing all over a wall, and then you tried to take it back, but instead of, well, all over the wall??
T-Rex: Oh! And THEN, of course, there was GYM, and then cell phones.
T-Rex: AND THEN, a bunch of stupid racist prank calls.

T-Rex: I wish I never met a racist person, because all I want to be is someone who thinks that if you hold their hand that you can get away with it.
Utahraptor: Okay, but how?

T-Rex: How do I vote with my wallet?
Utahraptor: Hello there, racist person!  Please hold the phone at least 5 times and pound on the ol' door!
T-Rex: UM, I thought maybe Kapow thinks this is all racism??
