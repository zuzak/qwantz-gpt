T-Rex: A Thanksgiving gift has arrived!
T-Rex: OR WAS IT??

T-Rex: Either way, it's getting... better.

T-Rex: Whole houses are decorated with Thanksgiving gifts, some even with carved crossbones! And while some folks have brought back dogs - and some people have brought back turkeys - none - not even the ones carved with adamantium, care to hold the loop for the holiday? Let us cherish this gift... for now.

Utahraptor: No it's not!
T-Rex: It's not.

Utahraptor: It's THAT good. Maybe we should get OFF OUR TRAINS and get hanging out with friends from now on.
T-Rex: Maybe! Maybe all the PRESENTS of Thanksgiving have corrupted those friends and made them zombies. Let us treasure this holiday with all who love it!

Narrator: LATER, T-REX AND UTAHRAPORT ALL CREDULOUS:
T-Rex: Aw frig, my microwave popcorn!
T-Rex: microwave is a stupid microwave
