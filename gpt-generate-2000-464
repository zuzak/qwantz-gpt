T-Rex: I've made another prediction for me: I'm going to be the most popular website on the planet.

T-Rex: It's gonna be based on the site idea!

T-Rex: If you click on a website, some website they describe as "funny stuff to do on their website", that website gets some money. But if you don't visit that website, then that website gets nothing, and so on, forever.
T-Rex: And I'm not even joking.

Utahraptor: You're saying we're going to eventually come to believe that people who wish to visit famous websites can simply visit websites that aren't that popular?
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: It works because we as a people are conditioning our behaviour towards popular sites towards expectations that we are super popular.
Utahraptor: Exactly!  We should be really popular to our own good!
T=Rex: Perhaps!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I am so super popular!  I can barely get a job.  I have to sneak a reference when I'm working in a non-tourism related way into my day.
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: Utahraptor, the man who trashes our little house has a sledgehammer in my mouth.
