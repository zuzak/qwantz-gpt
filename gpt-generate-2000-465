T-Rex: I've written a draft of a new book!  But before that, I've got a question: what does a gay male have to offer a reader??

T-Rex: I'm excited!  It's the perfect solution to every reader problem!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I'm writing a book about a gay male!  But before that, I've got a question: who is a lesbian?
Dromiceiomimus: I - I'm not a lesbian!
T-Rex: No!  I'm just here to brag!

Utahraptor: Well, you've got a question, T-Rex!

Utahraptor: Yeah, but you're not asking a question!  Instead, you're simply posing the question, "What is a gay male?"
T-Rex: Oh yeah?  Well if that's what I'm asking, this is my best guess at getting him to like me!

T-Rex: Now, what is a lesbian?  A straight male!  And what is a gay male without being attracted to gay people?
Utahraptor: Well...
T-Rex: Yes, I'm pretty sure that's a good guess.

T-Rex: I'll tell you what: a straight male without a girlfriend?
Utahraptor: Yep!  A gay male!
T-Rex: Oh my god YES, that's a good one.
