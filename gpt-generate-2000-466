T-Rex: Determinism is the idea that every decision made by us (our brains) is always, necessarily the correct one!

T-Rex: This means that even when I'm choosing a food group, all I have to do is guess at how their fate will be distributed throughout the group, and that's not a very good idea!

T-Rex: Plus, the decision making power of our brains would be limited to just a few exceptional cases - such as, random chance? - and the rest of the population would be left at very similar echelon.
Dromiceiomimus: But where would the rest of the population be?
T-Rex: I'd like to know!

Utahraptor: All you'd have to do is ask lots of people, and it turns out you're not really interested in taking large, representative decisions!
T-Rex: Impossible!

T-Rex: But asking lots of people to tell me how they feel about a given thing is kind of fun, since we're all familiar with these sorts of conversations. It also means that I can just ask the vast majority of people, knowing little about the nuances of emotional communication, would-be voters.
Utahraptor: That's not a very publicised mistake!

T-Rex: I'd like to know! Tell me my opinion!
Utahraptor: Leave me alone!
T-Rex: Leave me alone!!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Wow, everyone seems really interesting!
T-Rex: I kinda wish I was more interesting.
