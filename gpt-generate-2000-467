T-Rex:  This planet, which we call Uranus, is so cold that water molecules would dissolve even ice!  Instead, Earth is the result of a 20th century explosion in all kinds of waste:  industrial waste, marine waste, waste processed into food and feed, and finally, waste that's been trapped in our atmosphere for thousands of years!

T-Rex:  All this with a planet where the Earth is a sphere!

T-Rex:  So friggin' Eddy!  Your "dinosaur" planet is like a parking lot perversion, but it's so cold that water molecules would dissolve even ice!  Instead, Earth is a sphere on a par with comparably warm uninhabited parts of the planet.
Dromiceiomimus:  But then you leave the animals to go stomping.
T-Rex:  Man, that WOULD be a paragon of COSMIC STUFFING!

Utahraptor:  But stomping is fundamentally awful news!
T-Rex:  Shh!  Why wouldn't you find a way to be IAPS of mistaking?

Utahraptor:  Because if you wanted to discover what makes us different from other planets, you could just grab the closest red dwarf and try to work out its mechanics.
T-Rex:  Perhaps you'd end up stomping the planet like it's a boxing bag, only instead of punching it, I'm just going to leave you alone.

T-Rex:  ...
T-Rex:  Maybe stomping Earth is the light the planet needs?
