T-Rex: THE WORST THING TO DO IS BUY T-REX'S NEW T-REX-SENTENCES. COME ON, TREVOR!

T-Rex: I HAVE PROBLEMS ABOUT THAT!

Dromiceiomimus: I though that was a good idea, not hard.  I had some with me when I was a kid.
T-Rex: Oh, I'm glad we had the freedom to buy that right now!  We need more of those.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm glad we didn't have to for the sake of argument!  We can have more of that.
T-Rex: More of THAT!!

T-Rex: Buy the right thing and you can buy a stupid thing!
Utahraptor: Buy the right thing and you can doodle work?

T-Rex: Oh my god, what if the right thing was the WORST thing ever?  I'm not sure what I'M doing here!  I'm gonna have to look at a computer and make an evil T-Rex decision.
Utahraptor: Evil?
T-Rex: Evil PLUS MADNESS!!

T-Rex: And THAT'S how you describe MADNESS in general.  I guess I'd just have to look at the world once a day for, like two weeks a year, four years -
T-Rex: So It's Like A... Year-round Funtime for Adults?
T-Rex: Let's Try That!
