And The Deluge?" and follows my friend Tim, a young man who has the whole story under his belt, PLUS, he's got Tim's old pal, Gary, who teaches him how to make time travel happen.

T-Rex: ...Future T-Rex!

Utahraptor: T-Rex?
T-Rex: Utahraptor?

Utahraptor: I don't think you've thought this through, my friend! Listen, my story is about a guy who has the future all figured out, PLUS, he's smart enough to know some things that he's all well-informed. Is that better than STORIES that just TELL MOST PEOPLE?
T-Rex: INDEED IT IS!
