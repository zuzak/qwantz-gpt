Narrator: THE THUNDER-STORM OF SPACE
T-Rex: Ah, the ultimate space disaster.  As I was saying, no.  No.

T-Rex: The universe is teeming with life.

T-Rex: So many amazing possibilities!  Like what happens when you chop up a tree and it's infested, or you can bomb and it destroys the infested infested tree.  Wow!  Wow!  So incredibly awesome!
Dromiceiomimus: But T-Rex, what happens if one of the trees falls?
T-Rex: I don't know.  Maybe it's destroyed or whatever.  Or perhaps there's a giant meteor showering through the sky, and meteors strike the earth's atmosphere, killing off the planet's crust and causing global warming!

Utahraptor: Or whatever it is.
T-Rex: Or whatever it is.

T-Rex: Or the twirling of strange weather can be explained in mysterious ways.  One day a civilization led by someone called "T-Rex" swept through the sky, and it was as if the entire planet was caught in a mist.  It was as if someone had been manipulating the weather for generations!
Utahraptor: Or maybe it was the case when everyone had switched from being crazy to being normal!

T-Rex: Or maybe it was the case... WAIT!
T-Rex: Or maybe it was the case... I don't know...
T-Rex: Whatever, it was always more awesome to stay in my place, knowing that I could make things better.  And tonight, I can do that!  Tonight!
T-Rex: Or tomorrow!
