T-Rex: I have received complaints. Apparently I can be a prickly person who takes too much Chinese.  Apparently I can be both!

T-Rex: Apparently I can be both!

T-Rex: Apparently I can be both, because if I take too much Chinese and people will think I'm weird then maybe I'm really nice! And also, some people won't think I'm weird because I don't share my secrets.
Dromiceiomimus: Plus you can't trust someone to know MY TURN.
T-Rex: Plus I don't wanna sound crazy or anything but I really thought so.

Utahraptor: Well, if I don't share my secrets then the person won't be able to trust me anymore!
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yep! It's still weird, but it's finite, so you can't really trust an online dating service.  Plus, the people running such services are either super dumb or underinformed. 
T-Rex: Fine! I'm done now!

Narrator: LATER, T-REX IS WORRIED HE'S NOT HAPPY:
T-Rex: Whatever! I don't want to feel weird around people with cool, unshakeable secrets!
T-Rex: It's true! And it makes me feel weird knowing that everyone I've ever dated has cool secrets, and that with that they came from.
