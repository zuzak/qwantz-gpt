T-Rex: Determinism is the idea that every decision made by us, our brains, and our 'minds' is always going to be made by us, eventually!

T-Rex: This is because life can't continue as it did before our eyes, because we'd be dead before viability. We'd just be death: a forgone conclusion for the future, but one that we can take back with us at some future point.
T-Rex: So the brain doesn't make decisions, but rather creates 'reality' that is consistent and predictable!

Utahraptor: But what if you made the same decision and it's outcome was different, like for example you didn't have enough money?
T-Rex: Plenty of situations where this can happen!

T-Rex: For example, your brain keeps trying to process bad news until it arrives as a non-custodial care delivery system, delivering you to your bed or chair rather than an in-office transplant! 
Utahraptor: You'd be a dead man without a choice!
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: Try as they might, I can still see the origin of this awesome concept. If you'd made the same choice and its consequences were predictable, then you'd have learnt one of the CUTS AND you'd have learnt all that later! 
T-Rex: Alternatively, some aspect of your personality can still be effective!
T-Rex: That's why it's so satisfying to finally have a talking to and from source to friend!
