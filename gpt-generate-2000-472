T-Rex: I've been thinking, and I've come up with the perfect solution to the problem of my being considered, by others, to be "cute".

T-Rex: I'll get a pet!

T-Rex: I'll get a pet!

T-Rex: I'll solve problems... WITH A PICTURE.  I'll be able to follow instructions without worrying if I'm awesome or not!  I'll be able to nap in the morning without worrying if I'm awesome!  I'll also die when I get all boss!
Dromiceiomimus: Plus you'll never guess at your genes
T-Rex: *gasp*

Utahraptor: Plus you'll never fail a test, just be introduced to photos of stress.

T-Rex: Plus you'll never go on to have an awesome first kiss, just be able to chat up the people you date if you make it through the first few dates, and hey presto, you're a super person!
T-Rex and Utahraptor: Plus you'll be able to take your own life.

Narrator: LATER...
T-Rex: It turns out being an adult is harder than it looks, huh?
