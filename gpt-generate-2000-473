The Devil: GREETINGS T-REX I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THE TRULY EPIC SNUB YOU TREATED ME TO GET LATE
T-Rex: Holy crap!
The Devil: THAT WAS A GOOD SNUB

T-Rex: Okay, alright!

The Devil: THIS IS A GOOD ONE
T-Rex: Nobody gave a flying F for "this is a good idea!"
The Devil: BECAUSE IF SO I HAVE TO ASSUME THE POINT OF MY SALON
The Devil: IS WHERE I SHRINK THE WHITE NOISE IN THE LOWER PART OF THE UNIVERSE

T-Rex: So it's down to the squirrels to take the credit for that!
Utahraptor: One sec.

The Devil: I CAN FIX THIS THEN
T-Rex: One sec. Utahraptor, we're done!
T-Rex: Hold on, I'm gonna take the credit. One sec. Utahraptor, we're done.

The Devil: ONE MORE TIME FOR NON-CUTE THING SUCKERS
T-Rex: One sec. What?
The Devil: LAST NIGHT I MADE IT SO YOU CAN PUT YOUR HEAD IN THE AIR AND SAY THIS IS ACTUALLY A GOOD SNUB
