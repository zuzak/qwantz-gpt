T-Rex: You know what? FINE. I'll make a movie out of me becoming Superman, and then I get to write the script. And then they have to pay me the cow for the film and release me in swarms, and then they have to kill me and eat me alive so I'm never going back.

T-Rex: They can't do that with actors!

2: THE COMIC
T-Rex: They can kill me!

T-Rex: Then they can eat me alive, and then they have to take care of little meodles for them, but there will always be a Superman who can save me.
Dromiceiomimus: I think you mean "by yourself"?
T-Rex: Selfishly, I might write down some of my favourite parts of the comic.

Utahraptor: So let's see what you've got!
T-Rex: Selfishly!

T-Rex: Okay, so the first one is "I can't breathe, oh god, a dog!". What do you think about this?
Utahraptor: "Oh my god, a dog?!"
T-Rex: No I didn't! I just stepped on one.

T-Rex: "By the time I'm thirty I'm going to a dog show, Utahraptor."
Utahraptor: Is that what it's called?
T-Rex: That's what?
T-Rex: That's what?
