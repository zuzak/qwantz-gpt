T-Rex: I've been thinking, and I've come to the conclusion that

T-Rex: ... maybe it's time for me to get out and meet some new people!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, do you think maybe it's time for you to get out and meet some new people?

T-Rex: Um ... YES it is!

Utahraptor: Well, it's not much of a decision. You can still get a job offer from someone you like, but the offer need not be supportive and broad.
T-Rex: What? I still think that's great!

T-Rex: But let's be real clear: I absolutely value diversity in the face of intolerance, and so am going to accept whatever offer is justified.
Utahraptor: Really?
T-Rex: Absolutely!
