T-Rex: It's a new year, and there's no reason to be expecting much out of a long holiday!

T-Rex: However!

T-Rex: Some of the familiar features of the new year include: people who have just had their share of holidays, interesting facts about them, and/or interesting facts about the people who had them too!
Dromiceiomimus: Don't they?
T-Rex: They form the foundation of our entire culture.

T-Rex: The fact that they exist to great popular acclaim certainly does not bode well.
Utahraptor: Wow, so they do!

Utahraptor: Personally, I find this holiday-themed to be a worthy side-effect of the more "major" aspects of our holiday-themed culture.
T-Rex: Yes! And while there are many different ways for you to express yourself - literally, through art - I have chosen the most popular. Here it is!
