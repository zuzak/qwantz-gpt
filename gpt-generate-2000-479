Narrator: MAILBAG TIME WITH GOD
T-Rex: God!  What are you doing here?!

T-Rex: Hello God!  My name is God and I am here to make a joke.  Here is a joke that involves people who are trying to get inside his head.
God: THAT'S A JOKE
T-Rex: Okay!  Here is a JOKE that involves two opposite-sex people trying to get inside his head!

God: THAT'S A LIE THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE CONFUSED 
T-Rex: Hah hah!  See?  Like... a twist on a twist?
God: T-REX THAT'S A LIE THAT CAN BE CONFUSED 
God: SEE  A TOUCH THAT'S A LIE THAT CAN BE CONFUSED 
God: WOW
T-Rex: Man, I can't believe I didn't see better "here's a twist where two opposite-sex people are trying to get inside your head" lately!
Utahraptor: Let's hear it for yourself, dude!

T-Rex: Okay, listen, God, here's a twist that could lead to ENLIGHTENMENT.
Utahraptor: And let's hear it for YOU, personally: from within your own body!
T-Rex: HEY!
T-Rex: DICK IT T-REX
