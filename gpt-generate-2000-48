T-Rex: Who wants to come to a wedding where they can't see me? They can't show me what's on TV! They can't T-write me because I'm not T-real!

T-Rex: Or T-racist!

T-Rex: Or Rombitolerant, if you will. And someone who's really invested in their feelings and who appreciates honesty, but also sensitivity, cuteness, and a sense of purpose in a relationship.
Dromiceiomimus: I - I think a lot of people would prefer not to have a T-Rex wedding, because of all the stress.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm sorry!

T-Rex: I -
T-Rex: Because I don't like it!
Utahraptor: I'll say it!

T-Rex: I'm sorry!
Utahraptor: I'll say it!
T-Rex: I'm sorry!
Utahraptor: I'll say it!
T-Rex: I'm sorry!

Narrator: SHORTLY:
T-Rex: I'm so happy my sweetie and I can visit a T-Rex wedding
