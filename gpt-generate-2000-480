T-Rex: I saw the coolest mug ever yesterday! It's a mug with the words "H.A.M.E.R." printed on it.

T-Rex: It's a h.a.m.e.r! mug!

T-Rex: It's a medium-sized mug with the words "H.A.M.E.R." on it.
Dromiceiomimus: I don't think I fit it here, T-Rex, but let me know what you think!
T-Rex: Man! Since I can think of any reason why I should be buying a mug with these words printed on it, I will proceed.

Utahraptor: I think this mug would be a great mug, T-Rex!
T-Rex: You're my friend and even if you didn't like it, that's cool!

T-Rex: I like the symbolism of this, of course, but this mug is METAPHORICALLY the words "H.A.M.E.R." saying.
Utahraptor: I'm afraid your mug isn't for mugging, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Oh yeah? Well if you're so afraid, then mugging is on the next go-to move!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I'm afraid my mug isn't for mugging, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: What? Oh my god
T-Rex: Oh my god you're so friggin' awesome
