T-Rex:  Whoo!  Hallowe'en!

T-Rex:  It's Hallowentime and I'm running errands!

T-Rex:  So I get to WHICH store to DEFINITELY buy a Hallowe'en costume!  And I've got the creeps of old Robocop from twenty-something years ago, sticking up ournds like they're never wearing the new "grey suit" and saying "Hey guys I got this".
Dromiceiomimus:  Whoah, I saw that costume on the news!
T-Rex:  CHECK.

Utahraptor:  I got the creeps!
T-Rex:  I do!

T-Rex:  AND I'M SO GLAD YOU SUCCEEDED IN REMARKING WHICH SEWINGS ARE CLASSIC NOW!
Utahraptor:  I'M SURE YOU DID, T-REX.
T-Rex:  YES.  And all I'm saying is that if my parents had used "neighbours" in the past, I would be more of a 5'8" self-motivated dinosaur now.

God:  HEY GUYS
T-Rex:  I KNOW, IT'S AMAZING
