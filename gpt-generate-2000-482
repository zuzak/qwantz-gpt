Narrator: FUN FACT: ELECTRONICALLY, photons can be Photovoltaic (IC) powered out of the ground!

T-Rex: Indeed, this was my bold prediction and I'm sorry to break it to you, but ELECTRONICALLY, photons can be Photovoltaic (IC) powered out of the ground!

T-Rex: In fact, I'm sorry to break it to you all, but I'm sorry to break this excellent, once-abandoned "fourth wall" that you've built around me!
Dromiceiomimus: I, um - I was referring to the fact that once you ditch me entirely, I'll have no relations with you.
T-Rex: We'll just have to agree to be friends.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hey, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: Hello T-Rex!
T-Rex: Hey!
T-Rex: "Hello!"
T-Rex: "Excellent!"

Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: What the heck, T-Rex?
T-Rex: "Excellent!"

T-Rex: "Sell-out racist!"
Utahraptor: No, I was referring to... "MANHOOD racist!"
T-Rex: "S/he [sic] guy who doesn't even like [someone who pronounces it as]!'
Utahraptor: "HAHAH!"

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Man, it's all downhill from here!
T-Rex: The only safe way out is to... ride this thing out?
