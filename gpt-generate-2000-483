T-Rex: I have the best idea for a Batman comic. It's a Batman comic about a guy whose whole life has been built around his idea of Batman. All he does is solve problems, and the solutions are so unpredictable that if he reads a newspaper he could be doing it right now!

T-Rex: And there's no news agency to report on his daily life!

T-Rex: The only internet he uses is through his internet dad, who has a pet Pomeranian named "Bones" who he keeps in a box in his basement that he calls "The Simpsons T-Rex Box." 
Dromiceiomimus: ...Bones?
T-Rex: There's no internet.
T-Rex: He also has the following woman named "Debra" who he meets at the grocery store and they become ensnared in a web of webbing!

Utahraptor: It doesn't help that whenever he sees Debra, he tells her to go to bed - sometimes!
T-Rex: He's all about webbing!

T-Rex: He also has the woman named "Lolita" who seems to have a crush on him sometimes when they're not together!
Utahraptor: There's a web of webbing, dude.
T-Rex: And there's also a webbing of his answering machine!
T-Rex: When he looks up at a beautiful woman with a lovely face and a smiling face and talks to her he ignores her webbing!

T-Rex: He lies and says to her "Lolita, do you have any interests other than what you've discovered online" and when she says "No" he says "OK" and smiles and says "Great"
Narrator: iLOLITA GOES TO BED
