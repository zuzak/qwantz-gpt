T-Rex: I have a friend who has been married for over 20 years and is now their friend. He is handsome and I love him.  He buys me a drink and we stare longingly at the same old glass of wine.

T-Rex: They say that in the past, there was a time when we didn't talk about our love.

T-Rex: But we do talk now, and it seems that most of us are realizing that love is something that can and should be hidden!  I would like to have a private conversation with him about the issues of the moment, but I have to come to the party soon.
Dromiceiomimus: You'd better come prepared, T-Rex!
T-Rex: My friend, it's best to come prepared!

Utahraptor: No it's not, T-Rex!  You're going to slip.
T-Rex: What? You're not going to?

Utahraptor: Well, if it is, then it's not a very good party.
T-Rex: WHAT?
Utahraptor: It's not a very good party, T-Rex.

T-Rex: Do you want me to go lie down and relax?
Utahraptor: You - you're not going to go to a party, are you?
T-Rex: I'm not going to go to a party, Utahraptor.
