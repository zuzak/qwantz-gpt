T-Rex: A car accident leaves me in shock, but also terrified!  I don't want to get in trouble for not following proper insurance policies!

Narrator: "INSANE"
Narrator: a web card

T-Rex: So, I am in this situation where my car policy is "not a good idea" but my policy is actually a good one.  The policy covers all my special needs, but covers all my body parts too.  And the cards say "Not to worry, car" and the cards don't say "Not to worry, car" because they're just about the only cards we got.  I think the problem is that the different policies cover the same thing, even though nobody knows which.

Utahraptor: I can solve the "car" problem by giving everyone a car!
T-Rex: Do it, dude!

Utahraptor: Have everyone get car-proofed?  I think you could reduce the power consumption a lot, making your homes and cars "proof" for everyone.  Also, "proof" means "Not to worry, car" and if someone gets in an argument, I will assume they've been car-proofed!

T-Rex: But you're ignoring the issue of causation, right?  You're considering every policy on the planet, and you're not all "All policies equal, sure, but be certain not to one that I haven't touched."

T-Rex: CHAPTER IV, line 22:
T-Rex: "But even so, policy equal to the sacrifice of no matter how small, the One True Way out of this cabin, carotid artery, carotid flesh."
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: If I get a new policy my dentist has to make a decision that will have ME questioning the very IDEA of my dentist appointment, and possibly my entire professional record, forever
