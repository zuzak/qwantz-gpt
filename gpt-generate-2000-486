T-Rex: So the average adult is supposed to think about sex like, a billion times a day, right? Sometimes more?

T-Rex: ...Especially if they're bored?

T-Rex: Well if you average out every day of the adult adult's life over to today and we equate each of them to a single day of sitting on an empty lot, you get to that number! Today is the day we end the day with a "we think you should get out of here" message.
Dromiceiomimus: ...That's more like seven or eight?
T-Rex: Seven?

Utahraptor: That's a pretty conservative threshold, huh?
T-Rex: I know! It's what you're going to have to pay me.

T-Rex: But it's a reasonable threshold because if I were to guess higher, I wouldn't waste my time thinking up ways to make it less so! I'll just spend more of my time thinking up ways to make it more so.
Utahraptor: Holy cow!

Utahraptor: I'm serious! If you're going to start counting things as days until we're dead, then you should start doing that right now!
T-Rex: Oh my god, you're right! I'm going to spend YEARS thinking of ways to make it less so.

Narrator: THAT EVENING:
T-Rex: Oh man! Oh man! Oh God! Oh God!
T-Rex: That's CUTE
