T-Rex: I have come up with a way to be totally still while not dying!

T-Rex: AMAZING!

T-Rex: REMEMBER: doing something new and exciting with your life and new circumstances! Your old "going somewhere new and feeling really old" life might seem ordinary, but if you press it will actually let you go. You'll feel like being young and old again, being at home and being healthy again.
T-Rex: And you might even START TO UNDERSTAND THE ENGAGEMENT BETRAYING REALITY!

Utahraptor: Maybe just for you?
T-Rex: But remember: being young isn't just about being old! It's also about being alive, and if you're young you're not going to die, because that means things are not going to be great for at least a few years!

T-Rex: And this brings us to the exciting new world of computer simulations! Awesomeness!!
T-Rex: Computers simulate everything real well, so it would be really nice to simulate something she can't, well, know! You know how sometimes you wish the most, but you never wish death?
T-Rex: Computers do that for you... sometimes ONLY.
