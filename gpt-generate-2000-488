Narrator: A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR THE FRIENDS
T-Rex: Don't lie!

T-Rex: It's so easy.

T-Rex: Everyone can lie, but they also get to lie. Lies don't count.
Dromiceiomimus: Booormats?
T-Rex: No, but that's because there's no Lie-Not kind of guide. Here are some useful Dromiceiomimus tips!

Utahraptor: Booormats are pretty useless.
T-Rex: They're like - 
T-Rex: "Booormats are when you lie to yourself privately about something so that it might be of value to you, and so you lie to each other, and so you lie to yourself. Booormats are just terrible guides on how to live a nice life without doing things that are not worthwhile for you."

Utahraptor: Dude, I'm not wrong!! Guides on how best to live a nice life?
T-Rex: Man, you're on. I GUESS I'LL FIND OUT.
T-Rex: It's not like you can ask me about nice things now.
