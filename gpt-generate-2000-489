T-Rex: FACT: if the Bible were printed today, I would be asked to write a check for CHRISTMAS.
T-Rex: IT WOULD BE AN AMAZING DEAL!

T-Rex: Wouldn't it?

T-Rex: I'm serious. Wouldn't it be great? Christmas is printed today, and I could just go out and buy presents for everyone!
T-Rex: And I would have a check for CHRISTMAS.
T-Rex: And I would have a check for CHRISTMAS.

Utahraptor: You're saying you would get a check for CHRISTMAS, T-Rex!
T-Rex: True!

Utahraptor: But then how do you know if you would EVER get a check for CHRISTMAS.
T-Rex: Then I probably would not get a check for Christmas, because I probably wouldn't get a check for Christmas.
Utahraptor: And then you'd spend the rest of your life learning about the law from the people around you, and that would be a good thing?

T-Rex: Yes! And that would be a good thing.
T-Rex: I believe it would be a good thing.
Narrator: Next week:
T-Rex: Oh no!
T-Rex: Oh my God!
