T-Rex:  I'm not sure if I'm a pretty dude or just PARKING around in circles with my mouth open, either.

T-Rex:  I'm definitely not!

T-Rex:  I don't want to be a pretty dinosaur either.  I want to be one of those guys who gets his MOUTHS LOST FOREVER in a parking lot jerk-off!  -"cool as a pin" guys!  We should be cool as ducks, and I am the cool guy who gets his MOOPERS LOST."

Utahraptor:  You're not that kind of guy!
T-Rex:  You are!  I'm not cool as a pin guy either.

Utahraptor:  Okay, listen, I think I'm at a crossroads.  If I get my semantic definition of cool as a pin, I think I'll be able to navigate that.  But as I said, I'm not trying to get cool as a pin.  I'm not trying to get cool as a dude.  I'm just trying to get INCREDIBLY COOL.
