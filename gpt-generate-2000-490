T-Rex: I just decided to start dating Utahraptor!

T-Rex: It's the best plan I've ever seen!

T-Rex: It'll be SO MUCH MORE FUN, Dromiceiomimus.  I think I'm gonna become EXTREMELY into my favourite pastimes.  Is there anything you'd change?  Anything?
Dromiceiomimus: I really think we should date!  It's great!

T-Rex: We can totally get by in this world.  I mean, like, married and living life is great.  And now I can get by in my new town, of all places, being alone AND smothering in delicious organic delicious food is the best!  Yes, we can make it...of delicious organic delicious food.

Utahraptor: So let's get married!
T-Rex: We can get by in today's modern world, my friend!

Utahraptor: Sure!  We can make it even better.  Let's get married and make the first truly amazing organic marriage in U.S. history.
T-Rex: You're my friend, and you're going to be amazing.  You're going to bring reality to the present, and invite the married couple to come out on the town and get married.  You'll make my friends' marriages fail as soon as they realized what had happened.  And if they failed as soon as they realized what was going on, then they too will be wooed, and soon they will fail.

Narrator: THAT'S THE LITTLE THING T-REX EVER TELLS YOU.
Narrator: IT'S CALLED "ACTUAL RUIN"
