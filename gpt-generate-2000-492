T-Rex: A Story by T-Rex, All Comics by Connick

T-Rex: Shortly after we both died, you and your friend decided that it was time to move in together. Soon you and you came to Mine's defense, but in the heart of absolute insanity, you drove your friend out of the house.
Dromiceiomimus: Was that a "defensible" defense?
T-Rex: No, that was a "good one" defense! Mine and I argued endlessly about it for over five hours.

Utahraptor: Mine eventually agreed to move in with you and you drove away, Utahraptor!
T-Rex: You're forgetting how incredibly insane that whole thing was!

T-Rex: It was an amazing and necessary end to an otherwise amazing story!
Utahraptor: Mine never told you about it, dude!
T-Rex: He kept coming back to me!
Utahraptor: Well, it's your loss, T-Rex.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: "I never told you anything, God!" Mine said.
God: T-REX I ALWAYS LOST!
God: I NEVERMIND A TRIAL FOR GIVING AWARENESS
