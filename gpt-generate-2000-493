T-Rex: The saddest thing I can imagine is a kid who's 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or 12 or 16 or whatever. He's like a puppy dog, except he's a real person! He knows his name and his friends and when he's at the bus stop. There's a picture of him, but only if the friend is from the same school as the kid! It's depressing, because a better picture might show a happy little puppy dog, acting happy, and us all happy.

T-Rex: I imagine the pictures would be really good!
Utahraptor: You could probably use some picture manipulation!

Utahraptor: Okay, let's do it. Say your kid thinks she's a ninja and wants to be a superhero. T-Rex, imagine her as a ninja, and you can paint over her house painting and put a cartoonish drawing of her here.
T-Rex: YES. That would be an amazing manipulation.

T-Rex: You can go further, of course, but I just thought we'd look for a mutually agreeable medium.
T-Rex: Polymers, paint brushes, whatever!
T-Rex: ABSOLUTELY
