T-Rex: I don't want to take the Blazerate and we can all just accept that he's done with the sport!

T-Rex: But I mean, I sort of do.

T-Rex: You can still throw the ball back to the end of the half if nobody gets it to the other end faster. Hey, can we all just accept that he's done with the sport?
Dromiceiomimus: Of course!
T-Rex: Get it?!

Utahraptor: Well, it's not THAT important to him now. It's where you end the half: the end.
T-Rex: It's not?
Utahraptor: Nope! The League doesn't award franks to anyone, and unless and until they change they're just wasting their points on things they don't need.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I'm so tired from all the "me too"s and "ma'am"s and "rare stephens" I don't want to go to the gym!
T-Rex: ME too!!
