T-Rex: Man, I've been feeling down all morning. Maybe it's the weird sensation of something turning inside out...

T-Rex: ...but not too hard!

T-Rex: That's because when you press "C" you'll get a DOUBLE CHANGE and when you press "F" you'll get a triple CHANGE.  And when you press "C" AGAIN you'll get a 3D change, and then you'll stop being down and REALLY work through your feelings for the future. You might even get a change in name and you might even get a change in sex organs and that kinda works.
Dromiceiomimus: Sounds awesome!
T-Rex: LISTEN, I KNOW!!

Utahraptor: Suddenly, getting a 3d change in name and feeling down just feels gross.
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yeah!  And it starts with a blank page, and you're like, "well.. this sucks; I should probably just stop being down and actually get some friggin' hot crackers."
T-Rex: Hah hah!  I'm becoming one Dr. Who!

Narrator: SOON:
Doctor Who: i just decided to stop being down in order to ensure the future doesn't get RUINED by stuffing ME with new crackers
T-Rex: Everyone please keep this in mind when filling out my name or any other governmental document
Narrator: YES, I WOULD LIE
T-Rex: This will now be known as "Doctor Who".  DR WHINCUPPIN

Narrator: MAN I GOT NO IDEA
T-Rex: Who cares?  This is who we are now.
T-Rex: I - 
T-Rex: I'm not going anywhere
