T-Rex:  Hello world!  Here are some things I think are bad with me: 

T-Rex:  Baby!

T-Rex:  Boats!
Dromiceiomimus:  Boats are so cute that they can drown!
T-Rex:  Boats are so cute that they can mess up my life!
Dromiceiomimus:  Boats are so cute that they can kill the boat's life jacket by the arm?
Dromiceiomimus:  Boats are so cute that they can kill the boat's oxygen supply by the lungs??

Utahraptor:  But then why do they call the fish "boots"?
T-Rex:  That's a (NOUN)?

T-Rex:  Air!  Boats get all their oxygen from the lungs, so why should we care if they're the only ones breathing??
Utahraptor:  But then why do they call the sea "chest"?
T-Rex:  The answer is that the oceans support them and oxygenates the oceans.  But whales can breathe underwater, too!  They use oxygen as fuel, so sometimes the oxygen they hold underwater is filled up by the lungs.

Narrator:  LATER:
T-Rex:  The capsized down over there?!  I bet it was like a balloon T-Rex just blowing up.
T-Rex:  The capsized over there!
