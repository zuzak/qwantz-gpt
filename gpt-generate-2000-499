T-Rex:  All I really want is someone to hold me and tell me I'm special and special, and let's talk about sex!

T-Rex:  Is "kissing girlfriend" a good idea?

T-Rex:  I think it is!  I think that it would be a very nice thing to have sex with, just for the sake of it, and that it would be in good fun.  I think it would be something to go up to, and I think that it would be fun!  I think it would be so good that we should make out!
Dromiceiomimus:  T-Rex, do you think kissing girlfriend is a good idea?
T-Rex:  No, I think that it might just be a way to go up to someone and get some sex.  I don't know...seems to me like it could be something sexy?

Utahraptor:  So what's your take on it?
T-Rex:  I don't know!

T-Rex:  I don't think it's the WHOLE POINT OF it.  I think it's just, you know, that GEMM A/C is a bit of a hard thing to choose a girlfriend for.  Anyway, I think it's pretty clear that it's just, you know, sex.
Utahraptor:  I think that if you had a girlfriend, you'd want that.
T-Rex:  I do!
