T-Rex: One day, some dude had a vision and he wanted to help people in need. He was all,

T-Rex: "I need a robot to give people a voice!"

T-Rex: So he invented a vision system, and gave it to it and it got a vision system that told it where everyone would be on the planet. It was a vision system that let's it see where they'd be most at ease if they were in a box, and if it was far away, it could make decisions for them. It was a pretty sweet system, we knew that. Folks were happy. People were happy that their friends and family were happy.

Utahraptor: And now it recognized people living on other planets would be happy too!
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: So it fed into the already existing relationship between the universe' th erenadized and alive and acting universe, which at present, is mostly dead and dying, right? So the guy in the box could program a vision system that would let's him navigate safely around his problems, but also, it could let's him create robot suits that would prevent him from dying in the future just as Superman does.

T-Rex: Also, it allowed him to survive the rigors of space as effectively as Superman ever could!
Narrator: Later:
T-Rex: I was so confused!
