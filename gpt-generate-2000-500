T-Rex: I have come up with a way to be totally  totally  totally famous!  And this way, I'll get so great that nobody's talking to me for a whole decade!

T-Rex: I'll just have to be TONIGHT.

T-Rex: That means that nobody's ever going to suspect me of being famous, that nobody'll ever think I'm cool, and that nobody'll ever think I'm cool, even when I'm not actually famous!  So it ensures that, for the sake of now, I act like I'm famous, and nobody'll be worried.  It also means that, for the sake of NOW, I'll probably just be talking about my awesome super stupendous comeback.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm not sure if that's still the case, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Awesome! So now nobody's ever going to suspect me of being famous?

Utahraptor: And the reason is simple?
T-Rex: Because it Makes MORE Sense!

T-Rex: I'm the greatest! AHHHHH, now everyone's suddenly not worried because I'm famous, but because of a bizarre oversight!
Utahraptor: Oh.
T-Rex: Because now everyone's suddenly saying "Wow, he's an amazing dude! Nobody wants to be suspected of a suspect when they're actually super great people."

T-Rex: Man, that sounds like a great story for teens to read right now!
T-Rex: I'm PRETTY SURE that teens are getting this satire across.
