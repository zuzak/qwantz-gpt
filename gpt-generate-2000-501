T-Rex: I'm going to write the best story ever. It will be about the very best person to be married to, and they'll have to fight it out for all eternity.

T-Rex: It will take us into space, into our own friggin' realities!

T-Rex: It will take us into space, into our own friggin' realities where we don't know who else is or what else we can do! People will be able to hurt us! Badass people will try to hurt us!
T-Rex: People will try to kill us!

T-Rex: People will try to eat us up!
Utahraptor: I don't think you've ever done that!

T-Rex: Well, what have you done?
Utahraptor: I haven't thought about doing anything since I was a kid!
Utahraptor: Oh my god!

T-Rex: Oh! Oh! Oh! OH!
T-Rex: *sigh*
