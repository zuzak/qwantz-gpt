T-Rex: I somehow never quite found the "wow I just found the best way to be loved in the world" thesis bit of literature. It's hard to say if I'm the only one who's ever made it this far, but I do have the most incredible crush on my crush!

T-Rex: It's almost like a - I kinda - comes in and says "this thesis is way better than the person at who wrote it".

T-Rex: It's like if the other authors had written the story and said "hey, I heard about this sweet deal on the radio and figured if I wanted to interact with this person through texts, I'd better get more texts than this."
Dromiceiomimus: You're - you're not that person.
T-Rex: I am! SO PRETTY GOOD.

Utahraptor: You're not that person though! You write like a super-nice guy!
T-Rex: How nice!!

T-Rex: Okay, I'll say it: whether or not I get texts from this person is WAY better than whether I get texts from someone who doesn't have that option.
Utahraptor: ...
T-Rex: Okay, seriously?

T-Rex: If I were sent a text about to get married by mistake, the mistake being "I live alone and don't have a flatulentor", I'd give that a very serious 5. I don't know.
T-Rex: Okay.
T-Rex: Alright!
