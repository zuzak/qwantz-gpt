T-Rex:  Hello.  I am a man who is busy with other things.  And lately I've been going back to my pharmacy for what should be used in smelly-ass emergency rooms.

T-Rex:  As I'm about to say, the best way to be awesome is to get a pharmacy assistant as involved in your everyday lives as possible!

Dromiceiomimus:  Then she'll call the cops, T-Rex!  And hey, she'll report the case of "voluntarily" giving out medicine to people in the pharmacy for no reason!
T-Rex:  In other news, this is the pharmacy where I get my medicine from!
T-Rex:  MAN.

Utahraptor:  Then she'll take your medicine and stuff it into her emergency room, where it will eventually get into other things too!
T-Rex:  STUPID.

T-Rex:  For example, MAYBE it's safe to give out medicine to small-town women, since the elderly care less.  And MAYBE it's STRESSFUL NOT to give out medicine to THEM, since elderly women are NOT as interested in it as people in their prime working years would be.

T-Rex:  Oh.
T-Rex:  ...Okay that was pretty bad.
T-Rex:  I've since doubled the size of my mouth and swallowed three times as many chocolates.
