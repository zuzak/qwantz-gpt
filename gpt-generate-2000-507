T-Rex: I just found out that a hurricane is expected to hit this area!  Will the big storm raged for some time?

T-Rex: The big storm raged for a long time!

T-Rex: So geologists are going to be "going over" their work and then they're going to be "arriving" geologists are going to be "arriving" meteorologists.  It's going to be a good storm, but it will arrive just as the weather agencies are predicting a super storm.
Dromiceiomimus: Exactly!
T-Rex: And it will be a super storm, but it will also be a super storm that destroys entire towns, and then everyone is left in the loneliest ruins!

Utahraptor: The towns will collapse into a delicious pile of rubble!
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: The towns will rise again, this time from the tremendous megacomps and eruptions of the past.  They'll fall into the hands of newer, more violent forms, who'll have no trouble unleashing hurricanes upon this once-great landmass.
Utahraptor: I didn't know you liked history.
T-Rex: I like the symbolism of the arrival of new, greater storms.
