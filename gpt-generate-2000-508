T-Rex: I am a guy who has a lot of friends, but who still kinda feel like a year in the long run isn't worth it. But I'm going to change my mind and say the opposite.

T-Rex: I was wrong!!

T-Rex: I was wrong because I was too aggressive and didn't know UNC was going to pull this one out.
Dromiceiomimus: But you're not the focus of the fight, T-Rex! I don't see you as the focus of the fight.
T-Rex: Well, if that makes sense.
T-Rex: Good!

Utahraptor: I think the focus of the fight is on me, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Aww! You're not the focus of the fight!

Utahraptor: I'm not sure that's fair! I think every fight needs a winner to win.
T-Rex: Well, here's my alternative: every fight needs the person who were before me to win.

Narrator: THAT EVENING...
T-Rex: Man, who have's got the love life??
