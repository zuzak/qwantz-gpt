T-Rex: Okay okay

T-Rex: So I went to the chiropractor and he got a chiropractor. I was like, man, I don't get it, why the hell did I get into this get together?!

T-Rex: I was at the grocery store and my friend lady started talking about my neck and I was like, well, I don't get it and she ended up talking about my head too. And I guess I knew it was being talked about, but didn't I?
Dromiceiomimus: Yeah at the grocery store.
T-Rex:   It was  

Utahraptor: So I went to the chiropractor and she got a chiropractor. 
T-Rex: WHAT

T-Rex: I was like, man, I don't get it either, chiropractor doesn't even talk to me! I asked her what she was doing and she was all "stop", but then she said "oh hello, fluoride" and she stared at my head for a long, unblinking moment. I asked her what she was going to do to get the fluoride out of the water and she was all "donate some to charity"?
Utahraptor: Was she asking for it? The exact same question.
