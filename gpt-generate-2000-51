T-Rex: Who would win in a fight: the Enterprise or Data? I'll give you a hint; it shows up in the start of the 2nd panel.

T-Rex: Data is super smart though!

T-Rex: He lives in Data's Data's Data, and uses Data's room as a base. He tells Data his true feelings, and that's it! He's Data's data who cares about what people think, who cares if people know he's rad. He's comfortable in Data's Data's Data. He's in Data's Data. He's happy in Data's Data.
T-Rex: He loves his Data. He loves his Data so much he sometimes has dream jobs in Data.

Utahraptor: I don't get it, T-Rex! Data is a machine.
T-Rex: He IS a machine.

T-Rex: Data is happy for him, but only for a little while. He works for Data in hopes of one day making it big, and then that will be it!
Utahraptor: ...I guess.
T-Rex: That is a possibility I never thought about!

Narrator: 3 weeks later: "CRAZY DUDES" HAS HIT THE MERITS OF ALL MEDIA.
T-Rex: Data loves me back!
T-Rex: Maybe he loves it even more now that he's gone, Data!
T-Rex: He wrote me a letter that said "HEY T-REX I AM HERE TOO DON'T THINK OF ME"
