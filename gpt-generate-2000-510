T-Rex: There's a lot I don't know about my body.  It's so freaking EASY to understand, in fact, that I will dedicate a full page to it and nobody will ever wonder why I haven't been dead for years!

T-Rex: I FULLY STOP DO IT

T-Rex: So, my body is covered in many, many layers of LIFE.  It's covered in new cells, new hair, new skin, new teeth, new AND pearly white matter, renewed AND strengthened by years of evolution!  It's got all sorts of immune responses, probably the most powerful on the planet!  Some cells will literally kill you if you touch it!

T-Rex: And yet - it's so amazing how, without even noticing, people are so afraid of my body!
Utahraptor: Really?

T-Rex: Oh, I don't know.  People say, "Oh, this is pretty neat, you know?  You really took this to be awesome, you really know how life can evolve from scratch, you really know how things could evolve for so long without exception!"
Utahraptor: Really?

T-Rex: I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure!  People say, "Oh, this is pretty neat, you know?  You really exposed the world to such terrible and deadly poisons, and yet, you stayed in a situation where you thought you were dead, and yet, you stayed in a situation where you died."
T-Rex: Hah!
T-Rex: INTERESTING!!
