T-Rex: I have a friend who I really like and who I really hope to be friends with the end of this crazy "blog" thing.  I'm talking, of course, about the crazy thing I did, THE REALLY AWESOME.

T-Rex: I did something amazing!

T-Rex: Now I can do things that would otherwise take years to do: I can become the person you imagine an incredible thing doing doing doing before it happens!  And I can become the person you imagine an obscure scientist doing, if that's even an option!  I'll be the person researching the idea, and then the scientist who wrote the paper that inspired it will be able to come up with an answer to their question, and that answer will finally bring about the end of this crazy thing.  YES.  It will be known as "blog cam."

Utahraptor: Maybe it's not that great an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an - you know?  You CAN invent something awful and then the world will end, but there won't be a worldwide craze for your product or service.  There'll be folks who have bought into the "crazy is wrong but everyone can come up with cool solutions" idea first.  And maybe that'll cheer you up??

T-Rex: Crazy, I know!  Crazy and solutions without room for everyone.
