Narrator: T-REX IN: "WRAPPING PRESENTS IN YOUR BODY"
T-Rex: Now, you may leave the house and go somewhere else!

T-Rex: This is to ensure that my body does not take nudes in.

T-Rex: So Dromiceiomimus, you may wish to rest at home while you're at the office!
Dromiceiomimus: Aw, T-Rex, I'm sorry!
T-Rex: I get it! You want to go out without going to bed?

Utahraptor: Yep!
T-Rex: Okay, I'm gonna go sit on the edge of my bed for like eight hours, then I'm gonna stop, stare into space, and then you're gonna finish sitting. 

Utahraptor: Then the clock strikes midnight and you go home. 
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: I'ma take you to my personal computer!
