T-Rex: I am a dude who is really good at certain things, and I'm really good at certain things, and I should really learn to be a good conversationalist.

T-Rex: For example:

T-Rex: ...OUCH.

T-Rex: Is there ANY reason why I can't learn about the world by talking about these things?
Dromiceiomimus: Well - it's just that if you can learn about them through technology is hard!
T-Rex: WHAT? No! Because if I could, I'd take time out from my busy schedules and try to learn about things that I can use my TOMORROW CHANGES.

Utahraptor: That's not an option!
T-Rex: Hah! No!

T-Rex: I mean, no!
Utahraptor: Well, if you can do it for as long as you want, at least we'll be able to offer you some discount on some low-level aspects of your personality.
T-Rex: Hah! MAN.
T-Rex: QUITE QUITE.

T-Rex: You know how sometimes when I'm like this and the world is moving so slowly that I'm looking around and there's this shadow of a single person, and all I'm seeing is this smudge of blood on the other side of the screen? And then I can look and feel the changes, but is that really worth the trouble?
T-Rex: HECK YES.
T-Rex: I value experience and friendship and truth above all else!
