T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate bad guy!  He's got a mobile home against a wall.

T-Rex: And IT'S AUTOMATIC.

T-Rex: So if you're at all interested in the matter - yes. - you'll find the answer to your question is YES.  He has a mobile home against a wall.  If he moves it often, it's because he wants to keep things simple.  And if that small detail bothers him, IT'S AUTOMATIC.  You can too, if you like.  I think that's where my story stands right now.

Utahraptor: Yeah, AUTOMATIC.
T-Rex: I guess I just found the internet's for suck?

T-Rex: But it's still kinda perfect, huh?  I'm hoping I'm not the only one out there going somewhere not named "HTTPS://no-man-tomb-n-e-g-4-course-plans"!
Utahraptor: You're not the only one out there.
T-Rex: AND DOES THIS NOT EXPLAIN THE TIMELESS OF YOUR DEATH??
T-Rex: OH WAIT, MY DEATH IS NOT WHAT I THINK IT IS!!
