T-Rex: I've come across a way of making ANY film into an allegory! IT'S CALLED "NOT FICTIONAL MORTALS" and stars you guys!

T-Rex: It starts the same way: the narrator tells the camera on the roof of the house, telling the audience what he thinks!

T-Rex: He's going to say "Hey kids! Do you think the kids are racist? I know all about it! LET'S TALK."
T-Rex: So the camera moves to the kids and the narrator says "Okay now they're racist, but I sure of this!!" and the kids say "Okay cool, but what if the lyrics are just racist? I don't see how it can be an allegory."

Utahraptor: But what if the camera is right?
T-Rex: The audience says "No"

T-Rex: The camera cuts to the kids saying "YES" and the narrator says "I don't see how it can be an allegory."
Utahraptor: ...Okay. Okay.
T-Rex: Well it's going to be really good.

Narrator: LATER: NOT FICTIONAL MORTALS T-REX AND UTAHRAPTOR'S CAMPAIGN:
T-Rex: I'm so tired I'd rather not be out shooting swear words on set.
T-Rex: My agents have a case of the tears, you know?
