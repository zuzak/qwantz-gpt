T-Rex: Robyn was exploring ancient pyramids when she came across some mummies! And yes, she was going to tell us more about them, but right now: NO WORRIES.

T-Rex: This is why I leave you all to agree...

T-Rex: ...yes?

T-Rex: This is why I leave you all to conclude that Robyn found something that OTHERS seem to find compelling: that ancient creatures, while oddly alien to us, somehow found work at the societal backwater. They made things WHOM PEOPLE find comforting.
Dromiceiomimus: So you think society is being used for good, T-Rex?
T-Rex: It's true! In fantasy land, the humans she met worked as bouncers, and she appreciated the job well enough to let her boyfriend know.

Utahraptor: Aw man, that's terrible!
T-Rex: I know, but it's what people believe!

T-Rex: People have been saying for years now that Robyn RTsents is a VRAJICEIIST? An ancient being of ancient knowledge and knowledge-making was sent to us and brought us into the present, transforming our thoughts and actions into the Powerful Will of the Ancient World.

T-Rex: We are all Mystery People now, our futures EXPLAINTABLE to any future-twist we imagine!
Utahraptor: We're CRAZY, as are all of us!
T-Rex: Please enjoy!
Narrator: NEXT WEEK: T-REX'S TALK.
T-Rex: Robyn's talk...
