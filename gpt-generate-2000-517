T-Rex: I have discovered that I have something that will make me more relatable to others! And it's called SOCIAL ADVICE.

T-Rex: It'll let me feel more at ease about being social, about being essential to others - about being vulnerable to someone who wants nothing to do with me! And it's already been done in the past by some of my least favourite selfless acts of kindness!

T-Rex: I would have gladly accepted a small handful, taking weeks off my life spent helping others in need. Or days off if that was a cost I paid. Or HUNDREDS of dollars if that was a SPECIAL "1 off" offer I made to a stranger I didn't actually need.

Utahraptor: I think you should be grateful for all those feelings, T-Rex!
T-Rex: What?

Utahraptor: No, I'm not. I always say "serve up!"
T-Rex: What? SERVE UP?
Utahraptor: Oh, wow! That's something! I hope people care about selfless acts of kindness!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: I'm taking this moment to apologize to my friends for missing the date with my ex-wife last week!
T-Rex: Aww, I'm so sorry!
