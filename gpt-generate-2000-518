Narrator: COMPRESSED ORIGIN STORY COMICS
T-Rex: Today's origin story:

T-Rex: T-Rex the Dinosaur!

T-Rex: He's our new form of dinosaur, he's our new friend, he's our new dog!
T-Rex: He's our new bestie!
T-Rex: He's our new best friend who gets old and has a heart of gold.
T-Rex: He's our new best friend who gets old and has a head of a dinosaur, and then we all fall in love.

Utahraptor: How old is T-Rex?
T-Rex: 20?

T-Rex: Probably! I don't know! I mean, HE IS OBJECTIVELY UNSTOPPABLE.
Utahraptor: Who is this guy?
T-Rex: He's the founder of... ROCKNACLE??

T-Rex: If I were TALKING, I'd be saying "his name is Rocknacled Monk, but you see, that's his real name!"
T-Rex: "He was a good student, but he got into some trouble for not taking more classes quickly."
T-Rex: "He never spoke more than a few syllables in tone of voice, and at times, I found it hard to keep up with his talking."

T-Rex: "I asked him if he knew how to pronounce 'm', and he assured me that he did indeed!"
T-Rex: "The end."
