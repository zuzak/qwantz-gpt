T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate disaster movie. It is called "11 Angry MEN? That is a movie!!!"

T-Rex: It is about a "MAN" who decides to stop being a gentleman by becoming a more angry "MA" (literally meaning "man up"). The movie opens in a bar and the bartender reminds the "man" of himself, the stress of being a "man" and the greater world we live in. The "man" starts to sweat, his glasses falling off.

T-Rex: The movie ends with the bar owner announcing that everyone should go, "go get some beer" and going to get some beer. The man looks at his watch. "I've got a beer," he says, his voice becoming louder. "I've got to go get some."

Utahraptor: And then the bartender says, "OKAY. I'm going to stop going out."
T-Rex: Yes! THE END.

T-Rex: The next morning the "MAN" stops and the bartender says, "Did you get any beer?" and the "MAN" looks away, his eyes widened.
Utahraptor: And then the camera cuts to the second shot, and the "MAN" looks worried. He shot to the TV.
T-Rex: It doesn't matter what we do: OUR bodies will be showing up in the film.
T-Rex: THE END.
