T-Rex: I'm not a dude who ruins dudes. I'm not a dude who ruins dudes. I'm not a dude who ruins dudes. I'm not a dude who ruins dudes. I'm T-Rex!

T-Rex: Do you mean "I'm not a dinosaur and I am not a dude who ruins dudes"?

T-Rex: "I'm not a dinosaur and I am not a dude who ruins dudes! ... UNTIL I'M A DUDE???"
Dromiceiomimus: You're not a dinosaur, T-Rex! You're a DUDE who ruins dudes.
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus!! DUDE.
T-Rex (whisper): A comma is just like a meat cleaver, only it goes out and I discard the chicken; it's so accurate that it's -
Dromiceiomimus: Aww!

Utahraptor: Are you saying we'll see a sequel to our story?
T-Rex: Yes! YES.

T-Rex: Because, as I said BEFORE, I'm not sure I'M a dinosaur and I'm a dude who ruins dudes.  I'm not a dinosaur and I'm a dude who doesn't know how to make a living.
Utahraptor: Alright then!
T-Rex: Good luck with that!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I made it through the first panel!
Utahraptor: It's a long story I guess - I mean, it's not like I ruined dudes by not having one.
T-Rex: Hello? I'm a dinosaur and I'm a dude who doesn't know how to make a living.
