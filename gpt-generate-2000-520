T-Rex: I'm not as gullible as everybody realizes.  Turns out I am a little weird when I'm told the story of how my parents disappeared fifteen years ago!

T-Rex: However, it's still pretty unlikely that I'll ever meet up with someone like that again.

Dromiceiomimus: So - is there a program you have in place to "back up your claims"?
T-Rex: I'll say yes!
T-Rex: BASICALLY.  The only thing I have is an amazing case of The Case of My Parents.

Utahraptor: And it seems to have worked?
T-Rex: Well, actually!  The only thing I found there were old emails that had been sent and received since 1985!

T-Rex: The ones that were, um, sent and received after I disappeared were, like, "Holy smokes!  I'm having dinner with God and a CUPIDY."
Utahraptor: Ah.  That one is pretty clever.
T-Rex: "Cupids"?!?

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE...
T-Rex: Duh!  I accidentally sent an email that got lost!
T-Rex: That's it!
T-Rex: Back up your claims!
