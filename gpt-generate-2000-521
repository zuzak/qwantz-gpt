T-Rex: Water isn't really a metaphor! It's ACTUALIZINGLY a MALL.  We all just use water as a metaphor, right?  Because WHOAH, who uses water?  Let's listen to this song right now!!

T-Rex: "Lake wooooores"

T-Rex: "Lake woooores" are the two most powerful words in the dictionary! "Lake" has the hottest, nastiest, most important meanings in the entire dictionary! "Lake" can only mean "Lake wooooores" because wooooores!!
Dromiceiomimus: But - why don't you just use words that describe the same thing? LIKE "OILER-AFTERPLACE"?
T-Rex: I could write "Non-penicillin", "Non-penicillin", or "Non-oil", but that's a whole other topic!

Utahraptor: I'd just like to start with "Non-oil", as that's a very important word.
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Oil is like - it's very important?  Can we just define it as a "green" or "yellow" oil?
T-Rex: Yeah, our planet oil.  If we started saying "Non-oily", it'd stop working.
Utahraptor: It's legal though.
T-Rex: But it's not what's happening here.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: "Non-oil" and "non-oil".  It's actually legal though, right?
T-Rex: It'll probably be way more interesting when it's just one molecule thick.
