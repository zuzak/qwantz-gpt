T-Rex: I've come into possession of four AK-47s!

T-Rex: These were MY own FANGs, and I kept 'em holing up in my car's living room!
T-Rex: They were full of .44 Magnum semiautomatic rifles, and the owner of the AK-47R was carrying two .44-70s.

T-Rex: He was crazy.  I kept 'em holing up in my living room, showing him how I had broken them out and putting them in the back of my car!
T-Red: He was crazy too!
Utahraptor: He was crazy!

T-Rex: So crazy that I forgot how to operate an AK-47 without even consulting my instructor.
T-Rex: He made me do it too!
Utahraptor: He made us both FEAR the same thing!
Utahraptor: Fear HIM!

T-Rex: Oh man, that little joke somehow made me want to TRAVEL the world!
T-Rex: I am now wildly overstretched and am attempting to teach my friends how to operate an AK-47!
T-Rex: Is that true?
