Narrator: DATING TIPS FOR MEN
T-Rex: Men! Are you having trouble falling in love with a new woman? Maybe you think that could be a problem for you, since you've never been with someone before?

T-Rex: Then here's a friendly email for men, addressing all the issues raised above!

T-Rex: It's free, and you give them a few questions and then they'll say "This is pretty okay, because we're big into kissing dudes."
Dromiceiomimus: That's like... two good questions, for a low-hanging fruit!
T-Rex: It's different when you do it in a relationship.
T-Rex: I can imagine myself DOBbing at the prospect of polyamory, but it can also happen when you're in single-digit happiness.

Utahraptor: Yeah, it can be hard to reconcile these feelings of non-monogamy with the constant stream of new, attractive women you're walking down the street with.
T-Rex: Oh?

Utahraptor: Yeah, it can be especially hard for men who are ready to throw all their eggs in the same vat: how do they reconcile those, you know? How do they decide who's truly fun and who's not?
T-Rex: Polyamory can be smooth, for a variety of reasons!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!
T-Rex: Hey Shakespeare! Monogamy?
Shakespeare: T-Rex?
T-Rex: Monogamy?!
T-Rex: Monogamy, Dromiceiomimus!
T-Rex: Monogamy, OVERWEIGHT!

{{Image title: if you are falling in love with a woman, be sure to tell them and we will start a conversation.  AND ALSO, be sure to buy her handkerchiefs so that they don't look like you did here!  

{{Email subject: if you are falling in love with her, be sure to give her a second chance, as there are many better options available for a price}}
