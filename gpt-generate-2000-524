T-Rex: My stars, am I ever enamoured with the tattoo industry.  The tattoos are so great that your parents just got PR dollars for them;  and the best ones are the ones with hearts that "suck" into the next EPILOGUE 100% OUT OF CONTROL.  It's the coolest!

T-Rex: And yet, I still love them!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, tattoos are art.  They're painting, and they're art and it's awesome and everyone loves them and wants to show it in a romantic way.  But what I miss is when they're done and the artist has just returned to the drawing board, the tattoo artist has painted a picture of a talking dog in a glass of water, and the audience is left wanting more: is the arrow pointing to the past, or is it the arrow pointing to the future?

Utahraptor: T-Rex!
T-Rex: It is a compelling question mark!

T-Rex: Can you imagine a tattoo artist having a conversation, and THEN the recipient having a conversation AND the conversation isn't interesting enough?
Utahraptor: Well, you can.

T-Rex: And IN that instant, the ink is completely dry and the conversation isn't interesting enough, and the machine comes back with a new tattoo machine that can write new words on the wall or whatever and uses them there, so- finally, in my head I just want the present to have been interesting lately!
T-Rex: Question mark!!
T-Rex: Question mark!!

Mouseover text: the machine also includes a record player that plays shuffle music, and a computer program that swaps old songs onto the new one AND FLIPS THEM, which is kind of a big deal IF IT'S YOUERING)
