Narrator: THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF _______
T-Rex: Last Will of _______!

T-Rex: Okay okay so this time for a second, I WILL be giving away free Will Tote.

T-Rex: This will be VALuable NOT FORTHEN PURCHASING OR PURCHASE.
Dromiceiomimus: Can't you use this Will to purchase things UNLESS PURCHASING OF A WILL OF YOUR OWN??
Dromiceiomimus: No, that won't be possible.

T-Rex: Oh well! Will it be taken? I'll just have to take the time to find out!!
Utahraptor: This means that you can't just rely on the Will to act.

T-Rex: Man! That's not the best-case scenario.
Utahraptor: Yeah man!
T-Rex: And the best case scenario is that Will (IN THIS CASE, ITSELF) is somehow used to act in ways that prevent the Will from acting! Think about it!

T-Rex: Now if I just stole a Will from this Will, wouldn't that mean that I can't act in ways that Will-wise prevent Will acts?
T-Rex: That's what I'm going to argue.
