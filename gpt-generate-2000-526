T-Rex: Everyone's all "I wonder if my sense of smell brings tears to my eyesores."  It's terrible!  Everyone's all, "If our skin has red eyes then our skin has red eyes."  BUT!

T-Rex: Then it's totally fantastic when you say it in the third person, and people laugh.

T-Rex: I think what we as a culture have done is... get excited about it!  We've bought into the idea that we, as a culture, REALLY like something, and if you like it, you can get away with it.
Dromiceiomimus: But skin has red eyes too, right?
T-Rex: Skin DOES have red eyes, Dromiceiomimus.

Utahraptor: So you think we've learnt anything in this regard!
T-Rex: Not a thing!

T-Rex: We've done a poor job of explaining in detail the difference in look and feel between the two.  We've politicized the issue at large, and given voice to the long-forgotten question of what, exactly, makes someone, even in the broadest sense, unique.
Utahraptor: How does someone have to have such unique and deep-seated differences to be unique amongst vertebrates?

T-Rex: It's a shame, because they all have their own fascinating and unique ways of looking at things!  It'll be fun to watch some raptors do different things!
Utahraptor: Raptors!  Why are we evengynous?
T-Rex: Because we have the most badass dudes.
