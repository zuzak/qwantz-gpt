T-Rex: I am a person with feelings. And a friend. And a lifetime of feelings, but just the right amount of excitement until you let go and fall in love and then some?

T-Rex: SERIOUSLY IT CAN TAKE A while to build up to that, okay??

T-Rex: It can happen suddenly and without warning, and that is terrible. It can happen suddenly and without warning and it's totally acceptable. But in my experience, when there's a relationship that's building up to that, it can be really exciting.
T-Rex: I'm- I'm super looking forward to it!

T-Rex: And to the guy or lady who has been having all day today and then suddenly, giving up and leaving the door open for a relationship of their own volition??
T-Rex: Hmmmm
T-Rex: Yeah, that's pretty intense.
T-Rex: I'mho@ght.

T-Rex: How about: how much would it cost to let go and find out who you are then, what you've done, and where you're going?
Utahraptor: I would have to buy myself some Constance"
T-Rex: Oh man, that's a terrible idea!!

T-Rex: How about how much - how much do you want SHARERATING my interest in... well, being a heterosexual man?
Utahraptor: I would like to start a clothing line that sells UNDERSTANDING MANHOOD MANHOOD, a fine line that I am not going to break. 

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Wait, I forgot to make my list of things to do that year!!
T-Rex: Oh man!!
