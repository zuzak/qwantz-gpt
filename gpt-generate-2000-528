Narrator: HOW TO BLUFF YOUR WAY THROUGH EVERY CONVERSATION ABOUT SHAKESPEARE
T-Rex: The best part of this book is the conversation-slogician part. The book talks about how we need to BLUFF our way through every conversation about shakishlypears, because we're... TOTALLY ALONE.

T-Rex: But we do it sometimes!

T-Rex: Talking about things that are not really about us is a pretty serious ethical issue!  Is eating meatbanjo for a fivert topic?  Well, I'M going to BECOME slightly less ethical by talking more about ethics!
Dromiceiomimus: I think it's settled!
T-Rex: So, um... I'm wondering if it bothers you that I'm not a fan of the phrase "not really about us"??

T-Rex: Maybe, just maybe!
Utahraptor: What's it mean?

T-Rex: Honestly, it means that no ethical decisions could possibly be as arbitrary as "not really about me".  But it also means that -
Utahraptor: "Especially fine if the decision to never be a father (well, actually be a father for the rest of your life) is one that's probably going to be influenced by the experiences you've already had."

Utahraptor: "Especially fine if you've already had the good fortune to travel around the world as a child and even if that meant going to countries you didn't know??"
T-Rex: Man!  Plus, I'M the one making the ethical decisions!
T-Rex: *sigh*

Narrator: SOON:  HEY T-REX!  YOU'RE THE GREATEST COMMAND ASSASSINATION MEMBER ROUND!
T-Rex: Aw, now that you mention it, we've had YEARS of arguing about how great our relationships really are!!
Offscreen Voice: I'm cool with that!
T-Rex: I'm the smartest dude!
