Narrator: HOW TO PASS FOR A HUMAN BEING
T-Rex: Human beings are complicated, but they're ALSO not really that complicated. We've got like four main classes, but humans are like the rest of us!

T-Rex: We're split into classes of every kind, and each class gets its own special abilities and limitations!

T-Rex: For instance, we might expect that some people will pass for someone if they get their full looks directly on display. But if we're treating it as a performance art, then MAYBE some humans are just doing our eyes a disservice by not recognizing the full meaning of their interaction!
Dromiceiomimus: That's the problem with expecting people to interact with you in a concrete way.
T-Rex: That's a terrible idea!

Utahraptor: Or, as some people see it, as the solution to all of your problems!
T-Rex: Yes!

T-Rex: As philosopher Paul Grice said: "There is no such thing as a free lunch, because if there was, we'd all be dead."
Utahraptor: I agree!
T-Rex: I'm certain we'd all be dead!

T-Rex: We'd all be at different stages of mortality: some would see our bodies as the peak of the food chain, while others would see us eat as many bites as possible.
T-Rex: That is the paradox at the heart of the matter!
