T-Rex: People say that I am a wacky pervert because of the posters!

T-Rex: But, I actually have more posters than people think!

T-Rex: Therefore, I will become the world's greatest pervert!

T-Rex: I will dig more gravely for my graveling and say "Oh yes, the world's greatest pervert who will make our generation which will be the greatest in history".

T-Rex: I will watch as my parents say this as one of their proudest moments.

Utahraptor: But isn't the greatest in history just the person who was most certainly the first, greatest, and most incorrigible pervert ever?

T-Rex: Maybe!

T-Rex: Maybe the greatest in history is the person who would put a record-breaking 16 bars of French on top of a record-bleeding PUPID GAME ALBUM.
T-Rex: Or the person who would tear an old CD out of a CD player and play it over and over until you could Hear A Singing Son, Only It Was A Song Signed By The First Dude.

T-Rex: Composer/performer/guitarist/poet T-Rex, that's just a record, that's really all there is to it.
T-Rex: And I'm really proud of it.
