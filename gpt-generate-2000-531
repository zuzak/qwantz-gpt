T-Rex: I have the best idea for a Batman comic. It's called... "The House Where Superman Metahumps".

T-Rex: It's about a dentist who wants to have a superhero family.

T-Rex: Superman agrees to go on a diet, but he can't help but suffer one personal tragedy at a time. One day, a cat comes to live with him in his house. Then, a genie comes out of the bottle of lard Superman's got at the bottom of his can, and his runny nose grows back.
Dromiceiomimus: Animal issues!
T-Rex: No, animal issues.

Utahraptor: Are the animals sentient?
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: But what if Superman's animal side isn't sentient? Superman's a machine, and every frame of the comic is just a stupid shot in the back, close ups, and no background details are made. Oh no, what if Superman's a robot?!): oh.
T-Rex: Superman's robot side doesn't even have a robot voice!

Narrator: LATER, AHEAD, OF TITLE SCRUTINY:
T-Rex: Attention, everyone! My comic can only operate in dreams!
T-Rex: Another six issues later and you've changed the future!
