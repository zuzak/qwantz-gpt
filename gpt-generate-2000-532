T-Rex: I've been writing a book, and it's called, "Man, Everybody Loves Shakespeare, And I'm So Angry At The Hotel I'm In". It features over fifty words, but I'm sure I've written at least fifteen words!

T-Rex: I'm especially excited about this title, because it sounds like it'll be awesome AND informative! For example, here's what "Everyone Loves Shakespeare" would mean if you said "Everyone BEGG" instead of "Everyone Actually Got Straight Shakes."
T-Rex: Please.

T-Rex: "Actually I Really Think That Everyone Gets Straight Shakes" would be great!
Utahraptor: Really?

T-Rex: Utahraptor, please! It's so awesome! It's SO EASY to write an amazing title!
Utahraptor: It can be hard to reach an audience of people you haven't met in a while!
T-Rex: It's true! And sometimes there's the added benefit of reminding people you're talking about them!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: It's embarrassing!! I shouldn't have been doing this!
Person: Hey, let me talk to you about this
