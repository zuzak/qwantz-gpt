T-Rex: One day, the land on Earth and the sea on Earth got swapped! All ocean and sky and ground became ocean and sky, and water became ground.

T-Rex: Whoops!! Turns out this was fatal to the land!!

T-Rex: The land was filled with dead birds, fish and bats! And then the land magma began to rise up from the ocean, filling the magma with magma and causing the ocean to straighten up. Dead birds and fish and bats! The land was turned into a desert.
Dromiceiomimus: But then magma rose again, and birds and bats began to decay.
T-Rex: NO, THE ROUND JOKES ME

Utahraptor: The magma had a real protective effect on the magma, my friend!
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yeah, because magma seemed to melt down the dirt and rock beneath us and dissolve those objects into smaller pieces. And the magma seemed to prevent water from entering the atmosphere, making the planet cooler for our loved ones. And finally, the land!
T-Rex: ...Turns out that means our bodies are water's drink!

T-Rex: ...Um, that might actually be the case.
T-Rex: Man, I'm-
T-Rex: Um... I'm-
T-Rex: *I'malwaysup|> [[in progress]]
