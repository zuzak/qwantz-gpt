T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate foolproof way to lose weight.  There are many foods you can buy that have sugars in them, but there's no sugar tax, which is great!  I don't want to sound crazy, but there are also foods that look just like cookie batter that people throw away for later.

T-Rex: Next time you're in a restaurant, make sure you throw away some cookie dough because, come on, everyone loves to find ways to lose weight!
Dromiceiomimus: When you're done eating, throw away some more junk junk that you just can't eat anymore!
T-Rex: YES.

T-Rex: Throw away the bulkiest things ever, like the garbage that's piled up at the end of the drive-thru window!
Utahraptor: Um. Throw away the stuff that used to wash up on the other side of the door!

T-Rex: EXACTLY.  Throw away the stuff that used to breathe so that we might breath deeply after contact without the garbage passing through us!
Utahraptor: Um. Throw away the things that used to breathe so that we might breath deeply into the air to breathe in new life!
T-Rex: YES.  And throw away the things that used to breath new life into new sockets.

T-Rex: Throw away the things that used to breathe so that we might make new connections between ourselves and the garbage that used to wash up on the other side of the door??
T-Rex: YES.
