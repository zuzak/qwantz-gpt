Narrator: WHAT IS IT LIKE TO be a Giant Dinosaur
T-Rex: Hey, remember when dinosaurs didn't have a name we gave them a name?

T-Rex: We use the latest in mobility to get around!

T-Rex: But we also have the distinction of having the giest possible names. Consider the case of me! I'm a big dinosaur and I'm big enough to stomp a house with my mighty power. But then I get a blue ribbon and it's been a while since I've stomped anything.
Dromiceiomimus: Bigger is better!
T-Rex: YES. And so now I'm trying to get bigger.

Utahraptor: But isn't that kind of a good?
T-Rex: Yes!

T-Rex: We hire more people to accomplish different things in games. But we also make the game more fun, because we're all happy with their jobs.
Utahraptor: That's what we're saying!

Narrator: THE END
Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Congratulations! You are the size of your own body and you can stomp other players' things, right?
Utahraptor: Hey, didn't you hear?
T-Rex: I'm still big!
