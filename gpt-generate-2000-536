T-Rex: Is it possible to have too many friends?

T-Rex: The answer is "Definitely yes!"

T-Rex: If you are like most people, you probably have a few friends that you keep in close proximity to when you are not around each other.  A PUBLISHER Facebook group is a good starting place.  A PUBLISHING A Book of Chicks, especially for those with a sexual orientation not yet clear.
T-Rex: ...Sometimes I can see why that might not be the case.

Utahraptor: But you're probably not friend-aying like this!
T-Rex: I'm not PUBLISHING authors across the board!!

T-Rex: For example, one might be a PUBLISHING a cookbook for adults, especially for those with sensitive or otherwise developing tastes.
Utahraptor: And PUBLISHING a cookbook for kids?
T-Rex: Oh my god YES.
T-Rex: So concerning... the production of children's books on the sly!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: So... even if I were PUBLISING DUDES, I wouldn't be FRIENDS with them.
Narrator: ANYWAY, T-REX DECIDES TO WRITE AN INTIMATE STORY ABOUT A PUBLISHER, MAKING FRANKLY NOPUNCHES, SO THAT'S WHEN EVERYONE ELSE SIGNS OUT)
