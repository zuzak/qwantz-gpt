T-Rex: I have a friend on my faculty who is really strict about everything.  He puts vegetables in jars, and then he doesn't let me eat them unless I pay for them.  I asked him to stop, and then I refused to eat vegetables in jars because he swore I would dump him.

T-Rex: Oh no, now he's punishing me for no reason!

T-Rex: He says, "If you keep eating, I'm going to punch you in the face."
Dromiceiomimus: Should I punch someone in the face?
T-Rex: I don't know, Dromiceiomimus! Should I punch an evil kangaroo in the face?
T-Rex: I don't know! Should I punch a kangaroo that wants to hang out with ME for a while, AND then get kicked out of the tree?

Utahraptor: T-Rex, have you considered the consequences of your actions?
T-Rex: I have not?!

T-Rex: If I keep drinking, KELLY LEAGUE will be around long after the kids leave me alone and no one will care about me if I keep going.
Utahraptor: I don't think kids would mind, my friend.
T-Rex: They would!

T-Rex: In summary, if I keep drinking, KELLY LEAGUE will be around long after the kids leave me alone and long after I become a street-wisened homicide detective. Long after the kids leave me at the beginning of the new year. Long after I join the military!
T-Rex: Long after I join the program at Emerson College!
T-Rex: Long after I join the dude with the big GIANT GIANT TIGHTRIDGE coming out to talk to me about all the stuff I'm not supposed to talk about, ever!
