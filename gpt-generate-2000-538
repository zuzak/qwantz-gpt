T-Rex: I have a friend who got a PhD in PRIVACY, and that PhD has been published by PENGUINS OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION IN THE UNITED STATES.  He is a guy who will say "if someone wants to find out about [insert medical procedure they received while] being born they should call the doctor right away!"

T-Rex: HE'S MADE A NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTE HANDS

T-Rex: We're happy for him we're happy for him, we're all-sexy now!!
Dromiceiomimus: Should we be happy for him?
T-Rex: INTERESTING. Should we be all-sexy, all-i'm-the-worst, all-u'ma-do you mean "worst baby ever" people?

Utahraptor: Should we be all-u'ma-were, all-wereas?
T-Rex: No, no!

Utahraptor: Well then, we'd all be all were.  Were all wereas worse than the worst?
T-Rex: Aw MAN!!
T-Rex: Were all wereas worse than the premise of the show??

T-Rex: I want to say "Okay!  Did I totally get it myself?  Congrats, T-Rex!!"
T-Rex: Oh my gosh I did!!
