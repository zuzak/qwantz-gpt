T-Rex: You can't have two people involved in the same dream!  Or you can have dreams where the only people involved are the same age and sex.  Or you can even dream that if you swap bodies with one of them, you'd get a new one with different characteristics!

T-Rex: You can dream that you're both identical people involved in the dream, and have the same dreams even though you're never actually there in the first place!

T-Rex: You can even dream that you're the only identical person in the dream!
Dromiceiomimus: You're not?
T-Rex: Utahraptor?
T-Rex: That's crazy!

Utahraptor: I'm not!
T-Rex: You're totally insane!  Besides, all dreams are dreams, and all dreams are the dreams of others!

T-Rex: Anyway, I'm having my own private problems.  I just want some sleep.
Utahraptor: You alright?
T-Rex: Alright!

Utahraptor: Well, there you have it - my own problems! The problems of the celebs and the ridiculous dreamers.
T-Rex: Sleep apace!
