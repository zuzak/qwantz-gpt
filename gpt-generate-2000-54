T-Rex: It's been warm and then hot and then uncomfortably hot and then uncomfortably hot again, which suggests to me that there may be a warmer tomorrow!
T-Rex: Okay!

T-Rex: Warmth is the sensation of hot air in your lungs; it's almost like you're stepping, but somehow - intense?

T-Rex: It's exciting and it's like you're walking across a crowded room, your lungs filling with the stale, stale air.  It's incredible.  You're almost there, but then everything changes.  You feel like you could be stepping on some lead, but instead you're sitting in an empty room, your warm but wet clothes your sides.  People are closing in on you as you are sitting.  You can feel their reactions.  You can -
T-Rex: T-
Utahraptor: - They're - closing in on you as you're being pushed?

T-Rex: That's - that's really embarrassing?
Utahraptor: Um, that's - that's really erotic?
T-Rex: That's going well; everyone's bettering themselves!!
Utahraptor: I'm not sure we should be putting on the t-shirt; I guess I'm supposed to be dressing up for the occasion.

Narrator: LATER: T-REX GETS SEXUALLY EXCITED TO HIS BODY, ENTIRE SHOULDERS SHAPED OPEN, NEARLY AROUND HIMSELF, REFLECTING EVERYTHING PANEL BY PANEL.
T-Rex: Aw, suck it, suck it!
T-Rex: I'm so hot right now!
