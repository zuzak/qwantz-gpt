T-Rex: Okay, so I remember that time I bought myself some presents.  In fact, I was like, MAN, I'm going to get presents now!

T-Rex: But then I realized that MY parents had died when they were young!

T-Rex: And they told me that the reason they could talk about this so late in life was to give me presents, so when I got them I - I instantly regretted buying myself complicated presents!
Dromiceiomimus: But what did the parents tell you about your own funeral?
T-Rex: They said, "Honey, I get to make sure the rest of my days are filled with the relaxing family treat of idyllic childhoods ahead?"

Utahraptor: So what did they tell you... about your own funeral?
T-Rex: Just what did they tell me... that I will die today for them!

T-Rex: I - 

T-Rex: ... of course!
T-Rex: Man!  I should be doing this.
Utahraptor: I'm sorry!
T-Rex: They never told me that!

Utahraptor: Well, that's not very supportive.
T-Rex: There's still time!
T-Rex: ACTUALLY, the reason I bought myself presents was to give the elderly convenient means of communication ways!

T-Rex: In other news, the only way to save on funeral costs is to get a funeral service!
T-Rex: Seriously though, the service will likely be a depressing one with just the right amount of sad people in the audience.
