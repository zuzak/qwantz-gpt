T-Rex: I like people who have learntable adjectives, and who have done well in my LANGUAGE CLASSIC SATISFACTION.  They have been raised by my peers as "superbly challenged" and "an inspiration to countless thousands".  They have driven me insane!

T-Rex: They are, in fact, the only ones!

T-Rex: SUPERPLACE.  They have driven a young man insane, and left a trail of destruction through his family's back yard.  And when they pulled it off, I said "Who the hell cares about my superlecked monocle?  It's got to be someone better, and I'm pretty sure he'll pull it off!"
Dromiceiomimus: I'm pretty sure you did care about it, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Exactly!

Utahraptor: Man, you should be doing more, being a teacher, not less!
T-Rex: Teacher?

Utahraptor: I should be doing more, being a priest, not less!  I feel the same way, Dromiceiomimus! I feel the same way about everyone, even myself!
T-Rex: Really?  Really.

Utahraptor: YES.  Really?  Really.
T-Rex: Really?!  Really.  Honestly, dude.  You should be doing more.
T-Rex: Besides what?
T-Rex: We're going to end up marrying this
