T-Rex: So there's this conundrum that psychologists have tried to solve with the phrase "being alive".  Is "being alive" enough?  What if life is just a stage on a journey, like a human journey, and we've all just made our way through?

T-Rex: We'd probably end up in a world where we're all this tiny pile of crap, but then we'd all get to live forever and never die.

T-Rex: And this is the problem: we've always died as a species because we made an untamed journey into the cosmos with nothing but our skin and lungs exposed to the force of Big Bang physics.  And the cosmos isn't a stage!  It's a Universe.
T-Rex: And if it's a waste of a lifetime to just be back in one place, then what's the problem?

Utahraptor: Maybe the problem is our behaviour as a species doesn't follow some fixed rule!
T-Rex: That's true!

T-Rex: We're not perfect, just NOT that perfect.  But some parts of us are, and that's a problem.
Utahraptor: But isn't that a very mature and thoughtful attitude?  Maybe mature and thoughtfulness demands reincarnation?
T-Rex: Huh?
T-Rex: Maybe?

T-Rex: But all I've done is point out flaws and try to improve them!  I don't think I've ever been able to live up to that attitude.
T-Rex: I'm still thinking of my own future, maybe I'll go back to being a ninja Kameleon.
