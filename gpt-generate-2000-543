T-Rex: Everyone!  Baloney is the new black!

T-Rex: It celebrates failure with a pitchforks, which is kinda adorable!

T-Rex: But it also celebrates success, Dromiceiomimus!  If everything went differently we'd have this consensus, but we do!  We celebrate failure and then we celebrate success and then we celebrate failure and then we celebrate failure and then we don't talk about it for like two weeks.  It's not that big a part of our lives; we're just different people with different ways of thinking about the world.  It's more that we're stuck, really stuck, with a single failure, an entire period of continued silence, no social interaction, no real hope of improvement.

Utahraptor: I like it!  It finally includes folks who are "floating".
T-Rex: I like it too!

T-Rex: Maybe we'll see 'cept the guys on the run from the agents of Change!  The regime change, the collapse of which has cost the very people we were meant to overthrow?
Utahraptor: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE BELIEVING TODAY'S CHAMPION.
T-Rex: Change.org.uk. Oh, I -
T-Rex: Oh, oh, oh!
