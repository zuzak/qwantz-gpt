T-Rex: In the future, we can control our own offspring with our own little programming languages. Scientists are studying these children as babies!

T-Rex: They're studying how language early life gives us the strength to make them do even more amazing things!

T-Rex: One day a little kid named "Benjamin" was playing with his friends. His friends turned to one side and said "What's with Ben?" while Benjamin turned to the other. His friends shouted "He's not talking to us!" while the little kid on the other side turned to the other.
Dromiceiomimus: So his friend turned to one side and said "What's he doing??" while Benjamin did the same.
T-Rex: A full 20 seconds later, more of Ben's friends were running down the stairs. They were running so fast they made out and caught the tiny Ben in mid-air.

Utahraptor: And the astronaut on the other side of the screen was holding a book with words written in the kids words: "He's not moving!"
T-Rex: "He's not moving!"

Utahraptor: The other guy threw up a little and shouted "Ben, he's not moving!"
T-Rex: "He's not moving!"
Utahraptor: THE END.

Utahraptor: Anyway Benjamin's friends shouted back "What are you doing?! This is terrible! He's not moving!"
T-Rex: "What are you doing?! THIS is terrible!" shouted back Ben, Ben shouted back Ben back...
T-Rex: Ben, Ben! The astronaut on the other side of the screen was NOT holding a book with words written in the kids kids words: "He's not moving!"
T-Rex: "He's not moving!"
Utahraptor: And THEN the astronaut DID throw up a little book?

T-Rex: Yes! In my words: "A little kid with words!"
Utahraptor: Then Ben and Ben ran out of control!
T-Rex: Wait a minute! WAIT JUST A MINUTE.
T-Rex: Listen to what I said; I REALLY WAS throwing up a little thing back in December!
