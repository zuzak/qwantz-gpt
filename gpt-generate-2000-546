T-Rex: I received the following message:
T-Rex: "Hello Dromiceiomimus!  I'm the lady who took you for a ride in a stroller."

T-Rex: That's pretty sweet!

Dromiceiomimus: Holy cow!  I thought you'd sent a message to me!
T-Rex: I am!  I don't think you really understand what I'm saying!
Dromiceiomimus: I'm just saying - I thought you'd sent a message that might have been slightly less sweet!

Utahraptor: Man, you got me a ride!

T-Rex: What?
Utahraptor: You got me a ride!
T-Rex: Why would you send something that so many people might find quite tangential?

T-Rex: It sounded like you were just saying "Hey, I'm just walking into a place that doesn't exist and you wake up the next morning and there's this sign that says 'Dudes only', so there's this mutual distrust between ourselves and this place isn't very welcoming to dudes who can't just turn to avoid conflict by simply turning to their own aid."

T-Rex: "...Therefore"
