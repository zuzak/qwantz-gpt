T-Rex: Attention, friends!  I have changed my friend rating system!

T-Rex: I have changed the rating system so that rating friends is done by rating friends (friendship rating system)!

Dromiceiomimus: Well, at least you can't tell if a friend is good or bad!
T-Rex: True! But friends are relative, and people like someone who gets liked.  And if someone is so disliked that it can't possibly be an important thing, I'm happy.

Utahraptor: But is it really?
T-Rex: It's a social construct!

T-Rex: If it's relative, I don't think it's really telling.  If it's relative, I think it's telling us something, and if it's something important I'm happy with, I'm happy with it.
Utahraptor: Well, there you are!  I don't see any reason why rating friends should be done by rating friends.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary!  This October Fool's came back as a friend as often as he could during the current 24 hours, reporting on the current state of the world.  Sometimes he even went as far to buy TIME magazine!
T-Rex: It turns out, TIME IS ACTUALLY A SLIGHT, and he was being BROKEN FRIENDS WITH A MURDERER named "Time" BUTts up as well.
