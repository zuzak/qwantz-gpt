T-Rex: Who would win in a fight: Superman??

T-Rex: Superman's not really a guy for that matter!!

T-Rex: Clark's not really Superman's got that.  He's just - invulnerable.  Superman's got enough speed that he can run through water in a second, and he's not going to fall because he's vulnerable to falling.  So unless, ANDroids overcome flying cars and lasers and protogradas, we're looking at a long and hard fight.

Utahraptor: So who would win in a fight: Superman??
T-Rex: Superman's got that.  I'm not really sure.

Utahraptor: But the problem with Superman, though, is that he's fragile.  His access to water can be stretched thinned by his incredibly tall body.  The only way to overcome Superman's fragile nature is to travel to the past, where he still has his fighting spirit.
T-Rex: Superman!!
T-Rex: Superman's got the SHAKESPEARE KNIVES
