T-Rex: I have come up with the perfect cure for all those feelings from the hell I know!

T-Rex: I cure all hell!

T-Rex: It's so true! When someone says to me "T-Rex, you're such a good friend", I feel certain that they've somehow tried to downplay the sadness that lives in me, the person I am at the time. I might be the only one with feelings.
T-Rex: I know, it sucks!

Utahraptor: But maybe they've just tried to-
T-Rex: Too late!

T-Rex: I'm going to have to start treating them as if they're feelings, and then try to downplay the emotions they carry, assuming they're the same.
Utahraptor: That's like treating a broken leg as if it were a fresh spring, and then walking away.
T-Rex: Hah!
T-Rex: Easy!

Narrator: LATER, T-REX FINDS OUT THAT HIS CUE OF JOY HAS HAPPENED, AND THAT HE SHOULD DEFINITELY NOT TRY A RUSH TO THE POOPS WITH THIS CUE.
T-Rex: Easy!
T-Rex: THAT'S STILL THE CUE, Dromiceiomimus!
T-Rex: I GUESS I SHOULD DEFINITELY CALL IT "BEING TOTALLY STABLE"
