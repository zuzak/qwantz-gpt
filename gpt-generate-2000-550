Narrator: THE MONTH OF INTEREST:
T-Rex: Who owes me money?  The person at the very least owes me money!

T-Rex: I am the person at the most interest.

T-Rex: The person who most owes me money would be the person who most owes me the most.
T-Rex: Petty!

Utahraptor: But - you're assuming that every other relationship is the same.
T-Rex: Oh yeah?

Utahraptor: Sure, but you're privileging this relationship over that of your own.  Compare and contrast yourself against other potential lenders, who may be offering more attractive debt.
T-Rex: Oh my god I just love the taste of the financial services industry.
Utahraptor: Come on!

T-Rex: I love the taste of financial services!
T-Rex: It's called - "the nudge-to-talk to the lender" sort of stuff.
T-Rex: Man!
T-Rex: I know!
