T-Rex: COMPRESSED FILM COMICS: WHAT IF ALL THE GHOSTS WERE Sexy And I Had NO CLASS?

T-Rex: Then we'd all be lesbians!

T-Rex: Now we'd all be shot and killed: EVERYONE!
T-Rex: Shooting down any ideas of who we are as a people would be a waste of time: I'd have no idea WHAT kind of person we'd be shooting for shots at!
T-Rex: Or would I? I don't know: running blood around saying "I'm T-Rex and I say 'no'" all the time.
T-Rex: Shooting down any ideas of who we are as a people would be a waste of time: I'd have no idea!

Utahraptor: Shooting down any ideas of who we are as a people would be a waste of time: I'm actually totally against it!
T-Rex: I'm not!

Utahraptor: Oh, shoot, I'm shooting! Sheesh. I'm against it too! I think we're playing into this larger problem of homophobia in the media.
T-Rex: Hooray! We're doing something!

T-Rex: Hooray! We're fighting this problem head-on!
