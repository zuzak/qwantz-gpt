T-Rex: I am a guy who wants to be strong. I also am a guy who wants to be mysterious. And, um -

T-Rex: Anyway, I am here to talk about BEING strong.

T-Rex: Okay, so the first rule of being strong is to have a SMALLEST BREAK from the burden of others, no matter how small the difference in PHYSICALITY of the situation.
T-Rex: Okay, so be like a kid from a distance: hey guys, how's everyone treating you? If it's not friendly, maybe it's a kid from a distance) try moving slightly away from you (i.e.: a horse) and holding on for dear life!
T-Rex: Holy crap!!

Utahraptor: Second rule of being strong is to eat some food, regardless of distance!
T-Rex: Holy crap!!

T-Rex: Wait - did I say that? Does "someone close to you" not necessarily mean that someone in the distance regards you as a close relative?
Utahraptor: Does someone close to you "hold you close" to make life-changing decisions?
T-Rex: No!
Utahraptor: Well, I mean, it sounds like you're saying it to be polite.

T-Rex: OH MY God!
T-Rex: I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING HETEROSEXUAL FREEDOM IS THE SAME AS RIDICULOUS AS GENDERED NOUNS
T-Rex: FRIGGIN
