Narrator: COMPRESSED CLASSIC SCIENCE FICTION COMICS
Narrator: today's faith: the UNIVERSE WHERE I CAN TAKE STARDOM

T-Rex: The universe, we all know, is a simulation. But try putting a real-life science fiction story in the "real world" and it becomes possible to examine the precise nature of our universe!
Dromiceiomimus: We're in it!
T-Rex: WE'RE IN IT!!

Utahraptor: You can't just put an actual-life story in a real-life situation!
T-Rex: Impossible!

T-Rex: We need a universe-spanning metaphor that conveys the emotion of disbelief, loss, and/or hope! ADVENTURE is the key to a successful adventure!
Utahraptor: That's the metaphor we're using here, T-Rex! It's timeless.
T-Rex: And WITHOUT it, our universe will be much the same as it was before. Do you mean to imply that our universe is the result of just such a experiment?

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE I CAN TAKE STARDOM
T-Rex: I, T-Rex, am in a best of three situation!
T-Rex: And that means my universe is saved!
