T-Rex: "In my opinion, I mean... everybody"?  Sherlock Holmes sighed as he opened the fridge.  "I mean, in the last panel I think of the last sentence of the panel and it really seems to be somebody else's problem, so I'm not really sure how I do that."  He flipped out.  "In summary, I believe you have a 24/7 responsibility to find problems."  The television turned on.  "In contrast, yours is a 20/7 responsibility that I'm not really sure how to operate.  I'm afraid you'll find yourself being called a 'total jerk' at work."  The fridge was in his hands.  T-Rex sighed.  He read a newspaper.  It was this sentence: "In summary, I believe you have a 24/7 responsibility to find problems."  He glanced at the TV.  "In contrast, yours is a 20/7 responsibility that I'm not really sure how to operate."  He sighed.  He flipped out.  In summary, I believe you have a 24/7 responsibility to find problems.  THE END.

T-Rex: Afterword!  YES, THE FIRST PANEL OF ITEM IS IN UNDER 30 SECONDS AND T-REX IS TELLING EVERYONE THE SECOND.  (GROSS.)
