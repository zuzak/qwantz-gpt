T-Rex:  Hello world!  My name is T-Rex and I am a woman.

T-Rex:  Hello world!  My name is a VERB OR SMALL SOUND.

T-Rex:  So hey, Dromiceiomimus, who's to say you're not a heterosexual?  Or bisexual?  Or mute?  Or mute!
Dromiceiomimus:  Or APPARENTLY both?
T-Rex:  Or FEW, actually!

Utahraptor:  So say you're straight, but say this as a surprise, so that I can make out in my face what's going on!
T-Rex:  As you suggest, yes.

Utahraptor:  Okay, I'm going to say it now so it doesn't seem weird.  But I've got to figure out a way to sell this drink!
T-Rex:  Oh boy!!
T-Rex:  PLEASE

Narrator:  LATER:
T-Rex:  As he reflects, T-Rex smiles widely and says, "Thank you for listening. I am a happy and successful alcoholic."
T-Rex:  He continues, "Thank you for listening. I am a troubled and lonely alcoholic."
T-Rex:  He smiles again and says "Excellent! I have decided to take up smoking/ drinking again."
T-Rex:  A cloud of smoke rises from beneath their feet.
