T-Rex: I've got some sweet news.

T-Rex: I've just had the best meal of my entire life!

T-Rex: And it's all for a great breakfast! As you can see, I gobbled some up!
Dromiceiomimus: Nice!
T-Rex: Thanks, Dromiceiomimus!

Utahraptor: I've never had a meal like this!
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yeah, and it's awesome. You have to be the best in your class, even if you're just spitting out gum. At the end, I'll stand up and say "Hah hah hah! Let's all go sit in a boat for a while, okay??"
T-Rex: And I'll throw down my brie and tell everyone to come back when they're done.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hey, remember when I said I wanted to be an architect?
Passerby: Um... thanks
