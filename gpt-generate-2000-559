T-Rex: Woo! Hallowe'en!

T-Rex: Woo!

T-Rex: It's so nice to be reminded of all the memorable moments of our lives, and of all the amazing stories we've had the chance to read!
Dromiceiomimus: To that end, I will sing some catchy songs, including a catchy one about applesauce!
T-Rex: Hooray!

Utahraptor: I'm a Utahraptor! You're not supposed to show up!
T-Rex: You're not supposed to?!

Utahraptor: Sure, I'll sing a song, tell you what, and we'll go on a jaunt to the woods.
T-Rex: Yes! I will also lead a jog-a-lucky jig-out.
Utahraptor: It is hereby and sole our pleasure.
