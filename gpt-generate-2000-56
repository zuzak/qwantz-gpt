T-Rex: I have come up with a totally original way to prevent my superintelligent YouTube AI from trying to take over the world!

T-Rex: TuneIn allows you to watch any time and have it run at the speed of light!

T-Rex: So instead of constantly asking yourself "What's the future going to look like? Should I put my glasses on and live in it?" you could be doing the dishes, preparing the counter, and of course, getting the future its own post-apocalyptic future the world you live in.
T-Rex: And if that fails, you could just download some time machines and make the future take care of all your pressing concerns, including but not limetime, automated flight and dating!

Utahraptor: In such an environment, that's a recipe for disaster!
T-Rex: Disaster!

T-Rex: AND, future inhabitants could program their time machines to take care of anything they want, including making them pay billions of dollars every time they screw up with the future.
Utahraptor: The fate of the world as we know it depends on our weather.
T-Rex: If it's -
T-Rex: THE END
