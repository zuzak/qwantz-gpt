T-Rex: "Writing is hard!" - you know who says this? NON-WRITERS. This is because REAL writers know what a hard write-in is, and they know what a solid "written-in" is!

T-Rex: We all want more writing, real writers!

T-Rex: But we're not REALLY getting more writing. We're getting boring and uninteresting. Why not start with the rich and awesome and see what we've got?
Dromiceiomimus: Writers have jobs?
T-Rex: OBVIOUSLY! We should accept that and start rewarding the work of the prepared and the prepared says a good job, for all sorts of things!

Utahraptor: Maybe we should accept that, and start rewarding the prepared and the prepared says a good job, for all sorts of things, including but not limited to... SATISFIING.
T-Rex: Man!!

T-Rex: People are going to get tired of me!
Utahraptor: How?
T-Rex: Listen, I just wanted to ask -
T-Rex: WHAT?
T-Rex: T-Rex! Did you just fool yourself into thinking that you know the BEST BOOK THING TO WRITE IN ALL CAPS?

T-Rex: Because if you did, then I can write the BEST song!
T-Rex: My favourite song is called "Writing Is Hard" by The Beatles?
T-Rex: Did you just fool yourself into thinking that you know the BEST BOOK THING TO WRITE IN ALL CAPS?
