T-Rex:  I've got the best idea ever.  It's a Batman story!  But the Bat-Family gets together with a whole BAT-Family, Batman to fight crime!

T-Rex:  It's one-shot stories with the Bat-Family, who realize their greatest fear is turning their sleepy town into a real crime haven!

T-Rex:  But the twist is, the book's premise is the same premise as the Batman one!  And the audience gets to witness two completely different versions of the same thing!
Dromiceiomimus: BATMAN'S ORIGINAL STORY and BATMAN's GREATEST POINTING LATER.
T-Rex:  WHAT?

Utahraptor: TWO BATMAN'S ORIGINALLY COOL, right?
T-Rex:  Yes.  That's great!

T-Rex:  But the twist is, the book's premise is as good as the book itself!  The audience gets two different versions of the same thing, and there's no way the book's sequel will ever be okay!  THE END.
Utahraptor: THE END.
T-Rex:  Yesssssss.

Narrator:  SOON:  COMICS!
T-Rex:  Hey, comic book shows cost a LOT of money?
T-Rex:  I thought shows had doubled in value since the '50s!
