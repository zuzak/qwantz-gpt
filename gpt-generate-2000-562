T-Rex: My high school sweet teachers were lesbians!

T-Rex: They were the only teachers I had that I could trust to tell the truth!

T-Rex: In fact, it was the only credible evidence I had at my disposal that my heterosexuality was real! My hottie friends who were 16 were flying saucers in a "guys, I'm gay" haze, and I was the one who was the most certain.
T-Rex: I knew they were making an important point!

Utahraptor: It was a pretty convincing bit of logic, wasn't it?
T-Rex: It was!

T-Rex: It worked! My hottie friends were soon strapping teens into a car they made and driving it around town, until one decided they liked it: "What do you like about me, young man?", the other said. 
Utahraptor: Was this your first foray into the world of "flapper" logic?
T-Rex: It WAS!

T-Rex: The main thing that affected me was the incredibly persuasive and well-conditioned homophobia that surrounded me. 
T-Rex: It's this b-boy rage thing that usually tramples rational thought!
