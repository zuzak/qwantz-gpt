T-Rex: I have come up with the Art of the Deal!  Basically, you make stuff up where there's no obvious obvious obvious obvious obvious!

T-Rex: It's so obvious!

T-Rex: You'll be telling people stories such as "My favourite was the SMELLY PILOT position!" and then colour-coded props so that they think they're heroic, but then you can craft stories where your characters are the ones actually doing the talking.  Then you'll have endings, so that's what you've got to be doing.

Utahraptor: Okay, I'm done!  My story is called, "How To Make Stuff Up Where There's No No Surer True Clearly!"

Utahraptor: It's short (about five words) and it's a part of the book called "A Contract With Other Writers"!
T-Rex: Yeah, and that's how I figure it all works.  The contract is that I'm sorry if I'M on time for lunch, and that I should get as many times as I can before I'm fired.

T-Rex: I'm not 100% certain what I just did, but the rest of this one should be pretty straightforward!
