Narrator: PROBLEMS THAT CAN HAPPEN FOR FREE DOWN UNDER

T-Rex: Friends, can I get a job as a stripper?

T-Rex: I'd definitely eat out of a bag of chips if I had to, but I don't think I'm that guy interested in working as a stripper either.
Dromiceiomimus: But you're a stripper!
T-Rex: Sure am! But am I the only one?

Utahraptor: So you're not really interested in working as a stripper?

T-Rex: Maybe! But I've got my own money and if...
Utahraptor: Or if I'm rich and then they come back, what am I worth?
T-Rex: Two dollars! The kind of money that brings me so much pleasure!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I'm back in my old skin!
T-Rex: SEE?
T-Rex: The new you are the worst!
