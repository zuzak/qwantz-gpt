T-Rex: I am a guy who has a lot of opinions, and I have a good point!  So, here's my road map to social liberalism!

T-Rex: I will define liberalism as:

T-Rex: a person or a set of people who believe the world is a better place if they believe other people believe the same thing!
T-Rex: People will learn that some people are better at certain things than others are at others.

T-Rex: When I'm not being social conservatives, I'm social liberals!
Utahraptor: Can't talk about this is that okay?
T-Rex: Fine!

T-Rex: I will be polite when talking about social liberalism.
