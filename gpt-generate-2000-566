T-Rex: When my friends ask me what my favourite meal is, I usually respond with "cheese and chutney" or "chug'getublu"!
T-Rex: Pretty okay!

T-Rex: And if you're eating a meal, you're savoury-goodness eating!  I'm literally eating something that's good, and something that's GOOD.  And um, it's flavoured it to taste like some fancy chutney.

Utahraptor: Wow, that's a bit - um, patronizing?
T-Rex: Not really!  It's patronizing because you want the meal to taste like a sandwich, but then you go back and try it on the fly, and it's bland and delicious.  You want the reader to assume your chuggy-goodness sandwich is somehow, itself, delicious!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!
T-Rex: Shakespeare, have you noticed my interest in you?
Shakespeare: hello t-rex
T-Rex: So! Had you noticed my interest in... ME?
T-Rex: Oh, no!
T-Rex: Oh, my God!
