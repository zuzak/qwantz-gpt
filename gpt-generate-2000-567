T-Rex: It turns out the hardest way to become immortal is through the help of spells! We use the power of death to end the endless endless wars we all love and care about!

T-Rex: Only we can use our tears and our forks and our lives to become immortal too!

T-Rex: Now all we have to do is train ourselves a few simple death-defying techniques, and we're good to go! We'll be unstoppable - we'll be unstoppable. Even if our parents get killed by a falling lance, we'll still be unstoppable.
T-Rex: Then they'll have to face their deaths in a new, more tragic way.

Utahraptor: So let's put death and the threat of death at the service of all life!
T-Rex: Not necessarily!

T-Rex: If we're going to be unstoppable, then we'd better make sure we're not...too...early. Too late for the big fight. Too late for the person who lost a limb but is now unstoppable!
Utahraptor: Too late for love, too...for acceptance, too...for what happened?

T-Rex: Too late for acceptance that she didn't have the strength to die alone?
