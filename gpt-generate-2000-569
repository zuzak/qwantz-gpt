T-Rex: In the 1300s, when the world was still basically just three words long, people were working on words that would be useful in describing both people and things, generalizations that people would say to each other.

T-Rex: This, my friends, was the utahraptor utah-runner!

T-Rex: People were experimenting with words to suggest generalizations about the world around them, and this was like utah-runner 3: FLOOD. It was like when Wikipedia goes out of business because they took too much email!
Dromiceiomimus: You tried to be the best but you end up being the worst, right?
T-Rex: I think I'm probably way better now than I was before.

Utahraptor: Ooh! Or at least, I think I was. 
T-Rex: Or at least, I guess I was. 

T-Rex: Anyway!  I'm off to test drive an mp3 file and they're arguing about whether it's ethical to have a single best file format for the entire universe. 
Utahraptor: You think Wikipedia should adopt 28 file formats?
T-Rex: They should adopt whatever word pronunciations are appropriate for each of the 28 file formats!

Narrator: THAT NIGHT:
T-Rex: Man!  Ever heard of the MP3?  Of course!  Because it's the only file format that I don't want to give up my world, my friends, AND LAUNDRY LAUNDRY SCUMBAES.
T-Rex: I've only tried to give up my world because I don't want MP3s!
