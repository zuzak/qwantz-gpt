Narrator: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ETHICS AND MORALS
T-Rex: Ethics and morals are related terms popularly used in both the early and middle ages. Early people used these terms when expressing a strong desire to live a moral life.

T-Rex: It's where we're at RIGHT NOW!

T-Rex: But they also referred to a set of ethical principles that govern ethical behaviour today! These are the sorts of principles that define our relation to the world, as a whole, and what a good person would feel about doing things if he had a good chance of getting them all right.
Dromiceiomimus: So what did you decide to do with your life then?
T-Rex: I died of old age!

Utahraptor: And you said you'd like to live without shame?
T-Rex: My friend, I am not ashamed to be ashamed!

T-Rex: I had a good run, you know? In the early years of my life I ran up to people and whispered "Have you ever loved someone??" really excitedly. By that time I was a really good student!
Utahraptor: That's very mature of you, my friend.
