T-Rex: If I'm ever taken hostage by a fanciful government, it's to be sure that I get some sweet things in return!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: Thanks for the sweet little ray shorts, my friend!
T-Rex: It's definitely worth a try anyway! I mean, a true stranger might appreciate the "thanks for the ray shorts" gesture!

Utahraptor: And maybe a set of whistles, a whistles!
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: But maybe in a more literal sense, they're just a more literal version of the "thanks for the ray shorts" gesture I was just talking about!
Utahraptor: Or maybe they're just mutually reinforcing a set of USER-CONTROYABLE CONSTRAINMENTS.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!
T-Rex: Shakespeare! Can you help me get a set of whistles for "The Lady in the Lake" lyrics, by which I mean "stole" guns from?
Shakespeare: i'm not even joking
T-Rex: Aw, poor little teen!!
