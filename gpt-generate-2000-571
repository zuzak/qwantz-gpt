T-Rex: So in the story of Life, there's a woman who is absolutely perfect. Sure, she's florid, she's beautiful, she's intelligent, she's sexy, but she's also single?

T-Rex: Shut up!

T-Rex: I don't want to talk about it! You know what's great? Being alone in the single greatest house on earth? Being alone in a beautiful house!!
Dromiceiomimus: Aww! You're single, you're single, you're being single. 
T-Rex: Aw, that's just awful! And being alone in a beautiful house? Being alone in bed with a beautiful woman?
T-Rex: It's true. 

T-Rex: It's embarrassing and I want to hide it from you but I'm certain you won't!
Utahraptor: Why? 

T-Rex: I'm certain of it! You're so isolated you can't travel outside of the box! The rest of us don't get a single step of HOPE captured in our genome.
Utahraptor: But - why don't you get a whole lot of the same things? From all that?

T-Rex: My story is unique and I can never be 100% sure, but I do know that I will one day be the greatest!
T-Rex: I APPEAR of meeting you when I finally meet you.
