T-Rex: I haven't written a feature since middle school.  So I don't know how long I've been writing things.  I'll probably just keep working on it.

T-Rex: But then I realize that if I stay at home and write all day and never come to class and then I stop?  Then I'd only get one day of writing work done, and it would be... late at night?
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe?
T-Rex: Maybe I'll just work some other hours!

Utahraptor: Maybe you could come to class and work some other hours while you write your story?
T-Rex: I could?

Utahraptor: Maybe!  Maybe you could come to class and work some other hours while I decide whether to take a course of "I Can Write My Own Story"?
T-Rex: I will have that discussion at the conclusion of this tale!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I've decided to take on this role!
T-Rex: Doctor.
T-Rex: That's it for me Doctor!
