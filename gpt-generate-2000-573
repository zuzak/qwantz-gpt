T-Rex: Dudes!  Today is the day I buy a house!  I will buy another house!  The house will best my personality, and the personality of my friends will be...

T-Rex: ...decent!

T-Rex: But the personality of my house will be the most valuable thing ever!
Dromiceiomimus: How?
T-Rex: The ultimate individual house!  It will have, like myself, an exact copy of myself, and a copy which I will, in due time, love so much that I will despise the original!
T-Rex: ...Love you, Utahraptor!

Utahraptor: You're not buying this personality, T-Rex!
T-Rex: What?

Utahraptor: Come on!  You're ripping off me in the third person, right now, and then when I'm dead I'll be ripping off you in the third person.
T-Rex: Wh- What?  I'm ripping off Utahraptor!  I'm ripping off myself precisely as I now think he should be enjoying himself!

T-Rex: Whoooo!  I'm so sick of my friends saying "How do you feel about houses now?" and not knowing how to answer that question!
T-Rex: How would you feel if your friends said "I feel sick right now"?
