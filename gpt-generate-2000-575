T-Rex: I like to judge a person based on their actions, not on their reaction times.

T-Rex: I like to see if I can land on the high horse!

T-Rex: Well, here's how I see it: if I can't figure out how to make my actions seem appealing to some readers then I'm IN complete FAVOUR of landing on other readers!
Dromiceiomimus: Well then, how should we judge actions?
T-Rex: Well, here's what I mean!

Utahraptor: Our standard is usually between two and four out of ten!
T-Rex: Plus, our reactions don't necessarily tell us whether you're a good fit!

Utahraptor: Plus, our emotions can carry weight when we think about fit and health. Plus, in most cases, our judgments are influenced more by feelings than by science.
T-Rex: That's why I say "sensible" is the correct word.

T-Rex: Also, "sensible" has value!
T-Rex: It's nice and hugs sometimes.
