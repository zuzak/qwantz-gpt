T-Rex: So in case you were wondering...

T-Rex: I've been working on a new word!

T-Rex: "New" is the worst word, because it means "no longer acceptable"! It also means "no longer acceptable"! You can even say it like you're walking into an old guy's bar!
Dromiceiomimus: Like everyone??
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: So I've taken the opposite and created a new word: "Pukingkappe"! It's so bad that it rules (in the singular) but also goes on and on. You can even say it like you're walking into a bar (in other words, "going kapow").
Utahraptor: So the word is, um...

Utahraptor: New?
T-Rex: It's like it came out of nowhere, like "New Pukingkappe!!"
Utahraptor: Of course!!
T-Rex: It's SO GOOD, it rules.
Utahraptor: I want my new word to be kapow.
T-Rex: Wait. WAIT. It's not, like, a new word. It's just what I need.
Utahraptor: Are you... writing it down?
T-Rex: It's likely someone will write it down as I type, assuming I'm not already writing it down!

{{Title Text: kapow, if you're going to be writing kapow, make it even better.}}
{{Contact Text: kapow, i have conceded that premise.}}
