T-Rex: Today is the day, my friends!  I have a question!

T-Rex: Muscles!

T-Rex: Muscles!
T-Rex: Okay, so Muscles is muscle lengthening, and that can be pretty hard to do!  But there's also muscle lengthening in bedtimes, and that can be a problem!
T-Rex: Um.  IF YOUR BED GETS SEXUized THEN MAYBE IT'S TIME TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM?

Utahraptor: T-Rex, this is entirely useless!
T-Rex: Please, proceed!

Utahraptor: If your bed is sexier, THEN I'm now using the bedtimes I just described as "sexier" and not sexier as a whole.  Um.  Muscles lengthen muscles!
T-Rex: Okay!
T-Rex: Okay, good!
