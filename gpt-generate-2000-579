T-Rex: I have come up with an excellent way to be happy! Every time someone says a sentence, I simply add a few words onto it: 

T-Rex: "In my opinion, I mean, and you my friend, but for the LOVE OF GOD, you should focus your thought process on one sentence and I mean that as well!"

T-Rex: It's a shame we don't have the audio record for this, because it's really good. It sounds like you're saying "In my opinion, I mean, and you my friend, but for the LOVE OF GOD, you should focus your thought process on one sentence and I mean that too!"
T-Rex: It's true. It only takes a second.

Utahraptor: What about when someone says "But for the LOVE OF GOD, you should focus your thought process on one sentence and I mean that too!"

T-Rex: "In my opinion, I mean, and you my friend, but for the LOVE OF GOD, you should focus your thought process on one sentence and I mean that too!"
Utahraptor: What about when someone says "But for the LOVE OF GOD, you should focus your thought process on one sentence and I mean that too?!?"
T-Rex: INDEED!

T-Rex: Some people say "In my opinion, I mean, and you my friend, but for the love OF GOD, you should focus your thought process on one sentence and I mean that too!"
Utahraptor: That's pretty close to the "I" theme, yeah.
T-Rex: I know, right?
T-Rex: It gets even more special when you listen to it in front of a live audience.

{{banner: ADDED: now when you listen to "But For The LOVE OF GOD, Ichiikyou are coming to that party too" it's like a double-down on "In summary, I mean, and you my friend, but for the LOVE OF GOD, Ichiikyou should stay home}}
{{subtext: in my opinion, I mean, and you my friend, but for the love OF GOD, Ichiikyou should eat more chicken.}}
