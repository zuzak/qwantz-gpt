T-Rex: I have the best idea for a movie. It's about a group of teens who have decided that they WANT to go on a road trip... FOR SALE??

T-Rex: It's intense, I figure!

Narrator: T-REX AND HIS CREW:
T-Rex: So they get to set up their own road trip, and they're there to see it! It's great. They get some of the shots, they're there.
T-Rex: They agree to pay me $100 dollars an episode for the rights to my life!

T-Rex: I will be the guy to pay the bill, and I will get some of the shots! The ones that get to set up road trips are going to be great.
Utahraptor: I think we've got a long shot at making a movie, T-Rex!

T-Rex: Perhaps not, since I have to make a few characters out of thin air. But dudes, it's a movie! And I'm going to do it real easy!
T-Rex: It's not like I'm going to get a supporting role.
T-Rex: It is what it is!
