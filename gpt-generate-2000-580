Narrator: T-REX AND HIS DINOSAUR FRIENDS IN: "THE DUDE WHO COULD NOT TAKE BITES FROM A TEETH"
T-Rex: I was having a slumber party and my best friend Joe came out and said "Guys, if you had a triple double, you know what we'd do?"
T-Rex: I said I wouldn't say that because I'm afraid I'll be shouted down, but then I did.

T-Rex: Joe clarified that he meant "con artist", meaning he doesn't know what he's doing. T-Rex said "Because I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid"; Joe clarified that he means "because people will think I'm dumb" and I will be forced to say something stupid. 
T-Rex: Joe said "I sincerely enjoy cupcakes"
Utahraptor: "I sing the praises of my drink"!

Utahraptor: The only way it would be funny is if we just write on the cover and say "Check it: we're taking a page out of the popular book series." 
T-Rex: "We just do it for people who like me and don't want to take the risk of saying it out loud; don't worry!"
Uthah: "By the time we're done talking we should be at a restaurant where we're sure we're not being overheard."
Utahraptor: "We'll have a wacky party with inestimable personalities."

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I am so afraid I might say something dumb if I go to a wacky party tonight!!
T-Rex: :(
T-Rex: :(
