T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate way to be happy! Every day I can be happy is the best time of my life. I'm gonna be all, "GEEZ, I just have to be optimistic."

T-Rex: I will marvel at the futures of puppies and kittens while I rue the day I bought a home in an Agile World.

Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, you've got such an obvious plan, plus you totally blew my mind.
T-Rex: I know, and I totally will be pining for puppies and kittens while I rue the day I bought my new apartment!
Dromiceiomimus: I guess I too did PINE.

Utahraptor: I don't have any plans for happiness, T-Rex!
T-Rex: True!

T-Rex: I had plans all along for happiness, but when you put all your plans together they're actually really satisfying and then you can live those plans into your heart.
Utahraptor: Hooray! Happiness isn't a skill!
T-Rex: No, it's a necessary evil. Happiness is living a constant search for happiness in life, and that means dying of boredom or loneliness or...
T-Rex: No, I've got plans for that!

Narrator: LATER, AT HOME...
T-Rex: Man, my friends totally blew me a friendship!!
