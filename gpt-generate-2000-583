Narrator: THE NEXT MORNING:
T-Rex: I ate too much 'cause I ate tooooo many cookies!

T-Rex: But then I remembered that I probably had too many, and it seemed that by closing my eyes I might accidentally release too much CO2.]

Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, when you look out the window into the night sky, you might accidentally peek out through the curtains!
T-Rex: Hah! That's too bad! It was totally good, and I'm glad we had this conversation.
T-Rex: It was definitely awesome, you know?

Utahraptor: I'm not sure if it's possible to really know feelings without realizing it, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Me too!

Utahraptor: Well, I'll try! By seeing them through to the next MORNING.
T-Rex: OMG, who wants to watch the fireworks when they last? The ENTIRE UNIVERSE.

Narrator: AT THE NORM THIGH:
T-Rex: Friendship is the gift that keeps, courage the whip
