T-Rex: If your parents didn't have a mean step-uncle, you've got one too!

T-Rex: POINTLESS.

T-Rex: But if you're an adult who doesn't have parent-teats, then you're totally getting a treat from the REAL you, Uncle Dromiceiomimus!  Watch as I teach you NOT to trust your instincts.
Dromiceiomimus: Oh boy, I guess I have a sick feeling about here!
T-Rex: Can I ask you a question?  Because I do!

T-Rex: "Real you, real you", prince!  It is the #1 best verb in the UNIVERSE.
Utahraptor: And yet, here we are, TWO THINGS EARTH AND TWO FORTS AND FISHERY O'CLOCKS.

T-Rex: Two oceans, one forts and fiskers!
Utahraptor: Not bad, just a little concerning!
T-Rex: So - let's go back and forth, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: Super, super bad!!

T-Rex: THAT'S right, Utahraptor!  I'm reliving the same day two years ago... of great problems that had yet to be solved.  AND YES, the same day that THE ULTIMATE FANTASTIC TOUCH TRIAL OF '82 WAS CONSTANTLY NOT SOLVED.
Utahraptor: And you're going to tell me what you discovered in that meeting?
T-Rex: None that I know, Utahraptor!  I'm just a regular Utahraptor!
