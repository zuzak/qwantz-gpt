Narrator: PROFESSION EBOOKS:
T-Rex: Attention, self-identified "Bookie Folks"!  I am happy to present you today's book, "The Ultimate Secrets to Success! AND, Destruction!"

T-Rex: You'll need to have the perfect message, so download!  The secret is to use the word "UX" as often as you can, like once a day, for maximum impact.

T-Rex: For example, once I type "UX" I can expect to see the headline "The Ultimate Secrets To Success!"
Dromiceiomimus: But the message should be "We definitely totally totally totally totally totally totally don't die yet!"
T-Rex: Those sorts of things are impossible!  Those words literally write the word "up" into the air!

Utahraptor: You actually said "up" in the title.
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: When I type "UX" I can expect to see the headline "The Ultimate Secrets To Success!"
Utahraptor: You actually managed to type that carefully.
T-Rex: I promise we'll use it a lot!

T-Rex: The Ultimate Secrets To Success! AND, Destruction! ARE THE Ultimate Secrets To Success!
T-Rex: ...For the uninitiated, yes.
T-Rex: ...For the uninitiated, no
