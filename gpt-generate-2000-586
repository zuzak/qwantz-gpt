Narrator: COMPRESSED SONG COMICS
T-Rex: The first song I ever wanted to write was a song called

T-Rex: "The Race"!

T-Rex: Stupid lyrics, NO NINJA, there's no "Horse(tm)" after the "ㅠㅠ" before and a picture of a smiling T-Rex.
T-Rex: And there's a picture of me talking to a wolf, which is very cool.
T-Rex: "The Star-Spangled Banner(tm)" after the "ㅜㅜ" before and a picture of me with the text "One day we will be friends(tm)" after the "ㅟㅟ" after the "ㅠㅜ"

T-Rex: I wrote it myself and it's easy to read!
Utahraptor: Really!

Utahraptor: It's about a star with some problems who comes to Earth and says "I have the answers to all our problems." Then he gets excited and he solves all our problems, and then we all fall in love.
T-Rex: "Horse(tm)" after the "ㅛㅜ" before and a picture of me with the text "One day we will be friends(tm)" after the "ㅠㅜ" after the "ㅠ"

T-Rex: "The weight of civilization(tm)" after the "ㅜㅜ" before and a picture of me smiling(tm)" after the "ㅜ" after the "ㅠ"
