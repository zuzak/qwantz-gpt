T-Rex: I was going to say "I find it exquisitely funny to be the one to say the word 'dick"!

T-Rex: AND I WAS WRONG!

T-Rex: Okay, so I was thinking about how I could get a non-anthropomorphized non-dick to say the word "dick"!
Dromiceiomimus: And you've got other ideas, too!
T-Rex: Oh yeah? Well, I've got a better one: "Poojosse".

Utahraptor: That's a pejorative, my friend!
T-Rex: It's what cleanses the words they're referring to!

T-Rex: Anyway, I've considered several such ideas. One, which is that of "idiognomie", a very ancient and sexually permissive tribal sexual organ....
Utahraptor: Is it a pejorative, T-Rex?
T-Rex: IT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR!

T-Rex: Another possibility is that of "idioke", a more permissive sexual orientation, one that is found in animal species, as found in many tribal sexualities.
T-Rex: It's more of a cute sexual orientation found in plants.
