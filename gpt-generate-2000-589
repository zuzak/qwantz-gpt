T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate way to be totally invisible! Everybody calls me "The Guy Who Is Almost As Invisible As The Guy Who Is Now!" Okay, so I may sound like a jerk, but that's a good thing for our national interests AND that of our friends!

T-Rex: It's good for us to have a succinct, powerful image.

T-Rex: Isn't it? Isn't that a lot of work? Nobody wants to be invisible. I can achieve this by becoming intimately familiar with every stranger I've ever met, every strangerand every strangerwho I've ever kissed, and every strangerwho I've ever dated, and...
T-Rex: Every stranger! EVERYONE

Utahraptor: What are you talking about?
T-Rex: Being invisible!

T-Rex: It's like - it's like, all of us are seeing a tiny speck of a girl, just one shade away from us all, and we're filtering it down to the next person we've dated. It's a window into someone else's subconscious, by the way!
Utahraptor: So your ideal guy isn't as transparent as you!
T-Rex: I guess so! I dunno. It's flattering, I guess, because even SOME of my closest friends are seeing someone else's neat analogies!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND:
T-Rex: Shakespeare! Where are you?
Shakespeare: T-Rex, are you still playing Monopoly?
T-Rex: Playing Monopoly?!
T-Rex: I am still playing Monopoly!
