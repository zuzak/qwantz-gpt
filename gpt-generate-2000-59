Narrator: PRANKS AND DOCTORS
T-Rex: When I was a child I used to go and pretend to school and then sometimes pretend to eat food.

T-Rex: It was fun!

T-Rex: But then I got older and I was more into the TV and the games became more intense.  You know what's happening right now?  A lot of it is down to us pretending to watch the games but not actually doing them any other way.
Dromiceiomimus: Yeah, down to three guys pretending to be schoolteens.
T-Rex: Three down to three schoolteens!

Utahraptor: And you're not done yet!
T-Rex: Oh yeah?

Utahraptor: Congratulations, you're the host of the show "Game Changers"! We were going to go to a game, but now we know it's actually some really really really nice game places! A "Game Changer" contestant will tell you about her feelings, what she's going through, what to do, when she discovers she won't be able to play.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: My game is called "Burning To The Rafters".
Offscreen: [whispering]
T-Rex: My game burns to the rafters!
T-Rex: [whispers]Burning to the rafters!
