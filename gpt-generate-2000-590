T-Rex: It was crazy!

T-Rex: The dream was that the most important decision of my life WAS making way to Norway to go meet someone from the future!
T-Rex: It was a great idea!

Utahraptor: You're making this documentary?
T-Rex: It's good to be from a country with that sort of thing, my friend!

Utahraptor: Yeah, but isn't that weird? People from other nations going to Norway is kind of weird.
T-Rex: It's not! This isn't Canada! This isn't --

T-Rex: --
T-Rex: --
T-Rex: Wait!
T-Rex: You're not the only one from this country who doesn't want to go!
