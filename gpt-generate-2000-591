Narrator: WRITING GUIDE TO WRITERS
T-Rex: There are a lot of beginner's tips that will get you started on building up your skills on the go.

T-Rex: You can buy these tips in the main menu!

T-Rex: For example, the menu says "Get used to reading quickly" and the text is, "At least that means you need to get used to reading quickly." And the menu continues: "BOO!"
T-Rex: Woah! It's accurate.
T-Rex: It's like getting used to eating snacks at a party and then suddenly being super comfortable reading about how being super comfortable forces you to eat, and then being super comfortable reading about how that somehow PROMISES eating.

Utahraptor: So what if I want to learn about nouns and relations and have to remind myself why I like them so much, oh, wow, forget I said that!
T-Rex: No problem!

T-Rex: Here's what you have to grab: a) When you're beginner you need to feel yourself getting better, b) When you're having a long day you can ask your partner for help with anything, and c) When you have a relaxing bath or something.
Utahraptor: And that way it's super easy to know what to say when you're beginner!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Guys!  I- I'm really starting to feel like I should be having a bath!
T-Rex: ... 
T-Rex: ...Seriously, stop talking like that
