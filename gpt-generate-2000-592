T-Rex: I am a guy who is really into my favourite fictional character.  It's such an obvious thing to like that's really important!

T-Rex: It's like watching a movie advertised as being "romantic, family, punchable, funny, sexy, explosive, sexy, adult, sexy, adult, adult, adult, adult!!" but you know what it's like!  You're like, aged 60, talking to your computer while holding down the dang text "ENGINEering in full display: the video game Q&A!"
T-Rex: It's -
T-Rex: It's embarrassing

T-Rex: It's like, what if the only thing that makes me sexy is my age?
Dromiceiomimus: Um -
T-Rex: What?  Dude, ACTUALLY I'm around 18.
Dromiceiomimus: Yeah, but that's exactly what makes you sexy. 20 is how I define sexy.

T-Rex: Ooh!  Or perhaps 20 is the age of consent! Because as I define sexy, I intend to add elements of "age baubles" like "copyright", "copyright cheezed", and "copyright chewed".
Utahraptor: You sure defined those at the beginning of this, huh?

T-Rex: Yeah, it was weird, but then I thought about how we all defined "pubescent" for a while, and how that includes teens.  "Peak" and "old" are relative terms, and teens are years - if you can even call them that - from their golden years.

T-Rex: I should've defined that more, maybe?  Adults?  And, um, how come I keep my own memories?
T-Rex: We use technology to ensure a just and stable world!
