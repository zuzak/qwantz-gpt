T-Rex: You're a mammal, right? Or a bird, or a dog!

T-Rex: Or a dog and a bird!

T-Rex: It's a BIG secret, because nobody knows ANY mammals that know, or want to know, another. I'd love to learn this secret, so I'M the first to go! But it's a great deal easier if I PRODUCE it. Let's get this little thing running, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: Well, I'm going to have a great secret!

T-Rex: Yes! Great secret. So, here's it: you know about the invisible hand!
Utahraptor: Nobody knows a mammal that moves when she's rubbing their foot.

Utahraptor: Nobody wants to know a mammal that rubs their foot when they're walking around. So, here's how we're going to get this... secret... done.
T-Rex: Yes, I accept this here, easily 99.5% of the way there. I touch down again and this time, I'll be able to walk around and not get smacked about the bum.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE...
T-Rex: Ladies and gentlemen: I accept this here, easily easily 99.5% of the way there. I touch down again and this time, I'll be able to walk around and not get smacked about the bum.
T-Rex: Ladies and gentlemen: I accept this here, easily 99.5% of the way there. I'll touch down again and this time, I'll be able to walk around and not get smacked about the bum.

[[In T-Rex's thought bubble]]
T-Rex: I'm so glad we already are!
T-Rex: I'm so glad we're doing this now
