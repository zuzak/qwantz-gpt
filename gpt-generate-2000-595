Narrator: AT THE PARK:
T-Rex: Hey, who put that on me? I am not alone in this regard.

T-Rex: It's SO BORING that someone would put something like that on a bus they're not going to board, let alone take off and take to the bus. This is despite the fact that this person is doing this ALL THE TIME. Soffor, bus!

T-Rex: And it's also why people travel YEARS in a row to get to places they were supposed to go, and that means something's getting done differently, physically, for every traveler.
T-Rex: It's great! We've got records!
Utahraptor: What about people who died and were buried in deserts long ago?

T-Rex: What about that "long ago" that nobody even noticed was actually the exact location of someone's body for a few hundred years, tens of millions of years, long before the technology to reconstruct time was invented??
Utahraptor: Huh?

T-Rex: Anyway, who was responsible for this? Huh. I dunno. Maybe they're just irate jerks?
