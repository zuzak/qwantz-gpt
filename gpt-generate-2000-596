T-Rex: The greatest danger to humanity could be averted if we all agreed that...

T-Rex: bombs!

T-Rex: So bombs, ah, were a pretty good idea at the time. But then some atomic bombs dropped on Tokyo were launched against June, a month ago...
Dromiceiomimus: I'm afraid you're saying "at the time" here, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Sorry!

Utahraptor: Couldn't make an omelet without causing a disaster, huh?
T-Rex: See?

T-Rex: In fact, if I were to correct this mistake, I would like to have a museum about my past that will display all the things I've done wrong so that future generations can see what a good dude is up to.
Utahraptor: Really?

T-Rex: Why not? I guess I'd just like to visit... nuclear holocaust-style?
Utahraptor: Really?
T-Rex: Huh? Really?

T-Rex: Look, it's just a museum, right? If you can't museum something, why do that medium-telepathic communication between mind and body? Why not just make an entire robot out of you, and then mass produce that robot afterwards??
T-Rex: AWESOME
