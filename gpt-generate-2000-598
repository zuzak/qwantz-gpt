T-Rex: I have the best idea yet! I'll have a fully functional underwater robot underwater, and he'll be able to survive any weather - wind, rain, and wave!

T-Rex: Water will get us SO PISSED that we're letting someone else build a robot that can live in our basements, and that this will be as bad as FREEING UP WATER AS CAN be.

T-Rex: Water can act as a desiccant too, making our bodies react to it, which in turn can make our juices & fats SOOTLE. And if the waters get too cold, even dead fish will eat the guts from the tank, leaving behind the remaining remains of the animal. And as the juices & fats go into the tank, ANYWAY the chemicals in them - ACID, PREGNANT - KEEP LAUNDRING.

Utahraptor: This sounds like a robot who's never been used in combat, and then later, we get to punch him in the gut!
T-Rex: My experience with this sort of thing is limited to people, and even then only to people I know!

T-Rex: I'd like to think that one day I might actually be allowed to punch someone in the gut, and that I could have some imagined consequences that make me think I'm the one who's getting the punches.
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: That's a good idea, though!
