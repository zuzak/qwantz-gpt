T-Rex: Man, I'm never going to be a regular person. I'm not even going to be a pretty face.

T-Rex: I'm TOTALLY BORING.

T-Rex: But I'm not EVEN trim or uneducated! I've got all the basics under my belt, all the skills and know-how to become one of those guys! I'll be an engineer, or a neuroscientist. I'll have chops that regular people can't, and I'll have all the skills and know-how to build EVEN THE SENSE of a dying world!
T-Rex: Alright! What have I got left?

Utahraptor: You can build anything you want, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I PROMISE.

Utahraptor: BUT IT WOULD BE MASELLIC. It wouldn't be epic, because that's just the tip of the iceberg.
T-Rex: Then I guess I'd have to settle for "anonymous sculpting skills" knowledge instead!

T-Rex: In the end, I'll just need to put my hopes and dreams into the medium of sculpting my own future, which is something!
Utahraptor: That's not what this is about.
T-Rex: It's about getting over the initial initial pessimism!
