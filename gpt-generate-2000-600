T-Rex: I'm going to write some fan fiction. It will be my own, where I'm the main character, and all I'm doing is writing fan fiction.

T-Rex: It'll be awesome!

T-Rex: It'll be like... fanfic!
T-Rex: And I'm super excited about it. It will - 
T-Rex: It'll make me money!

Utahraptor: So what's the fanfic's premise?
T-Rex: I don't know! AHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHH!
T-Rex: IN SPACE!

T-Rex: Someone orders a whole ship of fabricated human skin stuck in a woman's stomach!
Utahraptor: Then what happens?
T-Rex: Then she chops the fabric off her stomach and stuffs it into the woman, who dies of embarrassment!

T-Rex: But this does not solve the woman's irresponsibility, but it does at least make her less irresponsacious. Oh! And by the way, how irresponsibly do you mean "by means of magic" or "by means of luck"?
T-Rex: It depends on the means used!"
