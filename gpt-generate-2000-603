T-Rex: I was asked by a friend of mine how he could get into a better mood by eating all the chicken wings!

T-Rex: Okay!

T-Rex: So I am a handsome, confident, funny, sexually mature gentleman!
T-Rex: I am experimenting with them!
T-Rex: They are starting to look pretty nice indeed!

Utahraptor: What if men like me but can't afford a mortgage?
T-Rex: Oh my god!

T-Rex: Men like me but they can never afford a mortgage!
Utahraptor: Doesn't that sound nice?
T-Rex: It's way better?!

T-Rex: What if I could get a job at a consulting house but it would mean so much to me and to other men?
T-Rex: What if that was the dream?
