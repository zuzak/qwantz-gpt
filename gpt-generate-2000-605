T-Rex: I am a man who, like many things, is predicated on "not even noticing" something that bad!!

T-Rex: Ah well, that certainly is true.  But then I realized that I had an oddity in my life- my favourite pastime was PICK SOME UPHORSES.  And that has opened the door to something greater...
Dromiceiomimus: Into... the future!
T-Rex: Into this vast and unknown space, where there are literally zero pastimes to choose from!

Utahraptor: You're looking for the future?
T-Rex: Into the future where I can play every future Picard game without anyone noticing me!

T-Rex: Only if you don't double your knowledge of the universe all the time, or zero!
Utahraptor: And then you can play the very last episode of Star Trek, and then zero the very last sentence.
T-Rex: Is that - IS that true?

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Today's sentence to learn: "Thank you for the present."
T-Rex: <<pew pew>>
