T-Rex: Okay, so I never took a vacation last year. I totally never would again. But I have some bad news: I had a really good time last year!

T-Rex: So, I guess I just never get to enjoy every memorable day of my life as if it's a completely different, and definitely far less memorable, event.

T-Rex: However, I do get to enjoy being T-Rex again. Because life's good now!
Dromiceiomimus: Isn't that a pretty good deal, $200 for something that only works if and when you achieve it?
T-Rex: Hah! I think so!

Utahraptor: So, you never actually get to enjoy being T-Rex this year!
T-Rex: I'm going to say so, and then we'll SEE about being T-Rex that day.

Utahraptor: Okay, you totally get to enjoy being the awesome dude who makes the ultimate purchase of food for people who don't normally eat it?
T-Rex: AWESOME. I am singularly creating and bestowing DIGNITY on all life forms, CHANGING themselves irreparably! 
T-Rex: I am singularly creating and bestowing DIGNITY on all life forms, CHANGING themselves irreparably?

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: $200 today I lose my glasses AND 3 MONTHS of wasted productivity = $3, $ so...
T-Rex: Oh YEAH I was paying $200 a month for years of well-managed, boring hours!
