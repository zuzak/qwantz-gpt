T-Rex: One of the reasons we can't all get a head start on a better life is that there's so much variation. I'm talking, of course, about vegetables!

T-Rex: A full six vegetables in the morning is a terrific idea!

T-Rex: Broccoli, chives, onions, kale, sage, chili peppers, and a little chives might help you sleep easier, while giving you a run for your money in life. If you've got the money, you might eat fewer vegetables each day to maintain your equilibrium!
Domiceiomimus: That's a very good point, T-Rex!

T-Rex: Vegetarians actually do tend to eat a lot more water than omnivores, which helps!
Utahraptor: Yeah, which also happens to be a good thing.

T-Rex: Well, consider this: if I eat seven vegetables, I'm looking for about the same sort of luck as I find in a stranger. That's how valuable vegetables are!
Utahraptor: And if you're hoping to lose weight by eating more vegetables?
T-Rex: Of course I am!
T-Rex: Vegetarians are for eating too much vegetables, and the world will end, Utahraptor!
