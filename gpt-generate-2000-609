T-Rex: I have a friend who was born in the year 6E, and has been buried under other people's bodies ever since.  The bodies of hundreds of other people have been found too, buried too under and covered in so-called "skull" clothing!

T-Rex: It's not my secret, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: Why don't you tell him?
T-Rex: I - 

T-Rex: I don't have any secrets!
Utahraptor: T-Rex?

T-Rex: Okay, good! T-Rex, that's it!  I'm not going to be challenged for modesty.  I'M not going to be embarrassed!
Utahraptor: Well, if you're interested in showing him...

T-Rex: I - interest?
