Narrator: COMPRESSED CLASSIC SCIENCE FICTION SHORT STORIES
T-Rex: Let's face it, genre slugs like NOT being genre slammed!

T-Rex: They're slugs for the genre, you guys!

T-Rex: They're slugs from a story that's been corrupted by it's own genre, and the only way to avoid this is to abandon any pretension of realism in favor of something a little more modern, like a series of courtroom cases would be handled.  Like a series of courtroom cases would be handled handled more carefully.  I'm sorry, graphic artists!
T-Rex: I just can't get past my fear of "geez deez"

Utahraptor: You know what's modern?  Twenty years ago you wouldn't even be able to make things look nice.
T-Rex: Twenty years!?  FOR REVEAL.

T-Rex: If I'm going to be doing any good, I'm going to be doing it better.  And I'M not just talking about good storytelling: I'm also good at stories too!  I'm good at centering my ideas around any set of circumstances that comes up.  And I'm good at stomping on things so that I might become that character they're in a way trying to get their own underfoot of!

Utahraptor: That's a lot of potential for improvement, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I know, and I'm glad we're not having this conversation.

T-Rex: I'm also glad we're not having this conversation because -
T-Rex: If I'd been, I could've just explained to her why I think stomping is the right thing to do, and then I could've explained why I think it's one of the few professions where women make up less than one-fifth of the sample size.  Instead, she became the talking face!

T-Rex: Amazing!
