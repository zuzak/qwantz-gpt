T-Rex:  Hello, Dromiceiomimus!  Or should I say.....Hello, Kelvin!

T-Rex:  Kelvin is a dude who doesn't even know what Wikipedia is!

T-Rex:  Oh no, MY entry on "FUTURE THINGS T-Rex" has now been translated into  the   "internet" and back again, and now it's at        
Dromiceiomimus: .../aspirin?
T-Rex:  Oh my god, PLEASE.  PLEASE.

Utahraptor:  You messed up, Kelvin!
T-Rex:  I didn't!!

T-Rex:  Well, I'm sorry, I meant "I messed up, unknowingly, but but that is a good thing".  And the reason it's at the         is because       you            websites WILL come up with   something like         Wikipedia: punctuation that is   perfect, and yet still        perfect.

T-Rex:  Two years later, I shouldn't have said that!  We shouldn't have made any joke that wasn't going to get published.
Utahraptor:  Not yet?
T-Rex: Not yet.

T-Rex:  Perfect.  We're still getting it published.
Narrator:  Back to the future!  Funny, amped up, and internet-ready for overripe insanity.
