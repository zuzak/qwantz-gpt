T-Rex: The saddest thing I can imagine is a kid who's very sick, but who still loves to play marbles in the park! He's got a mobile IV, and once it's in his hand it's like - 

T-Rex: - it's got a marbles!

T-Rex: He loves it. He holds it in his right hand up to show his friends, but as soon as he takes it he's going to die. 
T-Rex: Nobody ever asks me if I think about marbles before I die!

Utahraptor: So what's the sad part?
T-Rex: The hospital doesn't want the kid, and the kid's in the park, so there's a big bouncy house to the left of the kid's bed. 

T-Rex: Right, right.  The hospital wants to hold him there, but when they arrive he'll slip out of the hospital and land in jail a short time later. 

Utahraptor: And when he's in jail, the bouncy house is actually a prison called the "Red Star", a ruse developed by the TOILET to make it look like the hospital doesn't want the kid.
T-Rex: Yeah! 
T-Rex: Interesting.

T-Rex: The hospital wants the kid locked in the park for like two years, so they put rubber bands around their neck. 
T-Rex: And when he's in jail, he sits in a cell next to a LED TV that reads "I DON'T DO MARS, OH JERKS AND BE AWESOME".
