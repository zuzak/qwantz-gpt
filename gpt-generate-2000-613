T-Rex: I found out about a cure for eating disorders last night!

T-Rex: It's called "curing eating disorders" and it's been proven to be really effective!

T-Rex: Last night I went to a party and ate a lot, but I don't know if it's cure or cure plus. Crazy how?
Dromiceiomimus: I -
T-Rex: It's so easy!

Narrator: YES: YES, I WAS ALREADY SURPRISED THAT CURES FOR AN eating disorder are actually really hard.
T-Rex: I must have been a bit hard last night, Dromiceiomimus!

Utahraptor: I think it's actually pretty easy to recognize how hard it is to truly cure eating disorders!
T-Rex: I -

T-Rex: I'll pass that off as my own wisdom.
Utahraptor: Man, you're my friend! BUYING NICE THINGS is how I define friendship.
T-Rex: It's a little thing called GOOD NICE THINGS??

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: It's called, "signaling by intelligentsia". It's a way of reassuring you that things are going well for you, even if things might be going poorly for you SO DANG that now you think maybe it's time for some major changes. "Dear bro, maybe it's time for some major changes" are some of the earliest and most powerful words!
