T-Rex: I've come into possession of several kilograms of Nazi memorabilia!

T-Rex: It's a HITLER T-Shirt from 1990!

T-Rex: The "I THINK I'LL SUCK" sign on it reads "LUCKY" and the "i think u probably rap as u" print reads something along the lines of "rap as u, us as u, are probably not even rhyming" print.
Dromiceiomimus: These seem to be the only identifiable Nazi memorabilia runs together.
T-Rex: I have HUNDREDS of these HUNDREDS!

Utahraptor: Are you looking for Nazi memorabilia?
T-Rex: Look. Here's a tip: most Nazi memorabilia is being snapped up by other companies, so there's some Nazi memorabilia you probably own that doesn't belong on any larger corporate display.

T-Rex: Look. Look.
T-Rex: If I removed the Nazi memorabilia from this larger corporate display I would need to figure out how to get it back into the hands of an individual less likely to own it.
