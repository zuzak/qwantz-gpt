T-Rex: I have made a very important news! Last night I went to the hospital for an acute myalgic myalgic rheumatology!

T-Rex: Since my friends were there to talk with me and not for research, I was there too!

T-Rex: This means that day will pass without a phone call for me and without me ever being able to make a phone call back in time to save me from embarrassment!
T-Rex: Also, I will spend the rest of the day in the hospital, worried that if I wake up that morning the hospital might not be there for me, and that I'll be late for work.

Utahraptor: I don't think we've ever been in this situation before!
T-Rex: Why?

T-Rex: I don't know why, but it's pretty bad news! It's not like I'm going to be back in time to save me from embarrassment!
Utahraptor: Why not?
T-Rex: I don't know either! I'm probably just fooling myself!

Narrator: THAT DAY, AT THE HOSPITAL:
T-Rex's thoughts
T-Rex: I'm fine!
