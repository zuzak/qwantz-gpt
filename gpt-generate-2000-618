Narrator: THE UNIVERSE WHERE THE TURNS HAVE BLIZZARDS AND NOT ENOUGH DARKNESS FOR A while now

T-Rex: So... it seems I can get either of those things done?

T-Rex: Easily, I guess! And it's not like I'm going to DIE, you guys. Life is DANGEROUS, and everyone dies.
Dromiceiomimus: Then what?
T-Rex: What if they die when they're used in a manner that's not just ethically and ethically wrong, but also ethically and creatively and creatively bankrupt? I guess I'd just like to be able to complain to my bosses about my 'taking time off work to travel back in time to the 1800s' attitude.

Utahraptor: You think you can do both?
T-Rex: Heck Yeah!

T-Rex: I'll take the money and then have a conversation about ethics and that philosophy. I'm going to take the time and not be all about the bad guys, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: Quit Complaining To Me About Ethics And Stopping All Relationships With Bad Guys?
T-Rex: Seriously though, I don't know... ACTUALLY CAN do both?

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Aw - I should probably get used to living this life under a better name!
T-Rex: I'm out.
T-Rex: It's still my old name, though.
