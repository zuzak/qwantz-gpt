T-Rex: Once upon a time there was a prince who - lived happily ever after?

T-Rex: lived happily ever after?  prince lives ? lived happily ever after?

T-Rex: Well, he died, and then his body decayed and the magic happened.  I don't know why, but it's pretty hard to get a hold of, especially if you're a character created 3.5 million years ago.  I can't say for sure, but I'm pretty sure the story is really a one-way trip to somewhere.

Utahraptor: You're saying the stories we tell are anachronistic to the original?
T-Rex: Yeah!  I think the chasm is still there!

T-Rex: Anyway!
T-Rex: So! How do you get Henry VIII to visit you?
Utahraptor: You go to the south, visit a few towns, then get married in the north?
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: Then they marry in the east, where they live in a mostly-empty house, watching TV on the high-heel as they tear up a couple of sheets of paper that they hope will one day be stuffed into their giant, slightly-empty fist!
T-Rex: Ha ha ha!
T-Rex: I've got a few more years left on my current marriage but
T-Rex: I'm pretty sure it's working out
