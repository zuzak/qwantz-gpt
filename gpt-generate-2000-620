T-Rex: I like movies. They're good times! But, I also like movies that have actors walking around saying "HOLY COW<3".

T-Rex: It's clear from these two interviews that I REALLY DO like Movies.

T-Rex: But there are better ways to say "I like movies". One would be to say that they're "beautiful" and the other is "boring".
Dromiceiomimus: Best. And perhaps the easiest: to emphasize the essential!
T-Rex: Ooh! Or both!

Utahraptor: T-Rex, do you really like Movies?
T-Rex: I do!

T-Rex: I find them to be compelling! They're movies that examine our very nature, our nature, and our very souls.
Utahraptor: It would be much easier if we all just said "HEY CAME OUT OF THE TOY MOON WITH A REVENGE IN YOUR HEAD"
T-Rex: Dude!! That's not an option. That's not telling.

Narrator: LATER, WITHOUT ANSWERS TO OUR DISEASE MALFORMED:
T-Rex: Dear audio Ionia! You are now out of control and in need of a medical ambulance!
T-Rex: Also don't listen to my stupid "why didn't I say I liked bubba" segments.
