T-Rex: I have some bad news, everyone: I hope it's not plagiarism, because who cares about all the greats? It's plagiarism!

T-Rex: Folks just end up plagiarizing each other!

T-Rex: And I don't mean that we should be concerned about it - most people use the word "plagiarly" when expressing surprise and then some, and then folks simply stop and think "Oh, that's plagiarism."
T-Rex: What I mean is that we need to start thinking more about where we're coming from.

Utahraptor: I think what you're saying is there's a misunderstanding of what plagiarism is? And that's a problem!
T-Rex: See, everyone! We need to start thinking critically about what we're saying!

T-Rex: I just thought it was a rhetorical question, but now that I think about it more, it seems to be something more than just plagiarism!
T-Rex: I mean, I won the ability to say "Oh, that's it" in a sentence and now it seems to me to be something more than just plagiarism!
