T-Rex: So there's a whole spectrum of emotions, right? Pretty limited to the extremes!

T-Rex: I find those extremes TOO BAD FOR MY ETHNIC BEING SUPER WEIRDER!

T-Rex: Not according to this crazy theory!
Dromiceiomimus: Yes you do, T-Rex!
T-Rex: So! Anger is the icy cold opposite of sadness and has a temperature of -9 degrees Celsius??

Utahraptor: Yep! It's the opposite of good and bad, and therefore pure emotion!
T-Rex: Really? Wow.

Utahraptor: Yep! You're right. But then how come there's no such thing as sadness and sadness and SO MUCH ALRIGHT ABILITY?
T-Rex: Wow! I believe that seems more reasonable than crushing the soul!!
T-Rex: Daaaaaang!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: So! I'm torn!! I stand by my story and hope this never happens to anyone EVER!!
T-Rex: ...wait a second, wait a minute...
T-Rex: DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAO

<<sound effect: pop/wav>>
T-Rex: Man! Gross!
T-Rex: I only meant to make the story sound gross, but then I thought about that and it kinda dumbed down the sense of sadness I got from all this
