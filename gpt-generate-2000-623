T-Rex: It occurs to me that if I were to give up being a father, I would soon have become the paranoid schizophrenic.  I would become paranoid that my children would imitate me, and I would become paranoid that they would grow up to be everything I had hoped...

T-Rex: ... for the first time!

T-Rex: It's all very terrifying, Dromiceiomimus.  I am absolutely terrified.  I will start to imagine my own children as spooky ghost dolls for my children.  I will begin to imagine the sinister power of surrealism!  I will begin to imagine the power of paranoia!
Dromiceiomimus: I'm afraid that the next time you are home reading this book, you will read it under more careful reading.
T-Rex: It's too late!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Well, that's certainly a good point.  Besides...
Utahraptor: ...the book's not as scary as I thought it was.

T-Rex: ...which is to say when I'm being scared?
Utahraptor: Well, at least under more careful reading.
T-Rex: I guess all we can say is that it's definitely terrifying to imagine your own children as scary ghost dolls for your children.

Narrator: LATER: EVERYONE PUTS "SPOOKY" IN "IMAGINED SHORT"
T-Rex: Hallowe'en!
T-Rex: Hallowe'en LIES
