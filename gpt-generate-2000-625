T-Rex: It turns out all the animals we've domesticated for food are actually great and amazing creatures!

Narrator: GOOD NAMES FOR PLANS

T-Rex: All the plans for New England have been ruined by this plan! I wonder what the greatest city will be called, if there exists no such city as New England.
Dromiceiomimus: So it's a matter of which plan is more popular?
T-Rex: Yes, the former!

Utahraptor: So what'll happen to the plan to get us out of here?
T-Rex: Eventually it will be demolished!

T-Rex: But that's the beauty of domestication: all we have to do is find food and we'll be able to domesticate!
Utahraptor: We've got bloodlines! It's the same principle, but without the domestication of plants and animals we wouldn't be able to make it!

T-Rex: But I can domestically produce some pretty awesome animals from just that. Just shoot ME in the bum!
T-Rex: It's the coolest!
T-Rex: It'll be so awesome
