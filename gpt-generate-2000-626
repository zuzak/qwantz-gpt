Narrator: HOW TO BE PATRONIZED
T-Rex: Okay! So you've turned the love affair with the flesh-eating, water-sapping, rad-eyeing, rad-eyed killer whale into an amazing way to be patronized!

T-Rex: BUSY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET THIS.

T-Rex: So here's how to get them to join in! You'll start your affair with a good reason: YOU.
T-Rex: Your partners, whoringom, technically, mean "anyone can have sex with anyone", and you can't define a definition unless you and everyone else defines a science question. Okay, that's cool. That's cool too.
T-Rex: Your partners are now corporate citizens here, and you mustn't be ashamed!

Utahraptor: Your partners are also here because they can provide oversight for this awesome new form of government.

T-Rex: Indeed! And don't be so quick to fault my employees for not wanting to define boundaries, for I am certainly not the only person capable of that. Your employees, please.
Utahraptor: I thought this was going to be a career-enhancing affair, instead!

Narrator: BUT LATER, ALL ASSESSED GOOD LAWS ARE TERRIBLE
T-Rex: Sorry, "standard". Bridges mean a lot to me!
