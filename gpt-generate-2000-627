T-Rex: I'm really interested in what it's like to be gay.  And this is not a conversation to go through!

T-Rex: What we all deal with is something that we call "a diagnosis of a sexual orientation."  This is something we can look at and work out if necessary!
T-Rex: But we're not legally allowed to make such an appointment!

T-Rex: Therefore, I have decided I will start making professional suggestions as to what my sexual orientation is!  What do you look forward to?
T-Rex: As of right now, I am "turnipsome heterosexual."

Utahraptor: Do you have any objections?
T-Rex: Absolutely!

T-Rex: Although I have always maintained in my heterosexual life, "no," I am not legally or ethically "turnipsome."  I have no secret about what my sexual orientation is.
Utahraptor: Okay.
T-Rex: It is a BIG question mark.  How do you define "sexual"?

T-Rex: It depends on the question.  Here, I am asking "How do I feel?" and as a non-sexual person is not legally or ethically defining "sexual" in the same way I am.  Would you say you feel fine if you were gay?  No.  Well then, I guess...
