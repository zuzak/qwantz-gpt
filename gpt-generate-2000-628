T-Rex: "The Utahraptor's" is the worst word. It means "devilishly wicked uncle who calls his kids 'Grandma' and teaches them to call their own little games 'Quiz Slippy Slapper Quiz Sloppy Slapper'?"

T-Rex: Um, like... anything else??

T-Rex: So evil uncle Chris died, and his body is still around, but his mind is entirely different. He's living in a bizarre mansion on the internet, reading obscure community comics, staring at his TV, while his two closest friends wait in the wings to book him. Somehow it all fits!
T-Rex: I dunno, I think it might?

Utahraptor: The internet doesn't let us print words for anything, and the words are printed on the internet itself.
T-Rex: Explain!!

Utahraptor: The internet runs in a "don't talk to me" loop, and whenever someone texts us "t-rex you're late" the software crashes.  So the only way we can get out of this stupor is to Google "understandability in the language of obscurity".
T-Rex: EXACTLY. So we continue to search "t-rex" for "essence" and "annoyance". But our search for "essence" has now led to nothing less than the discovery of "the Utahraptor".

T-Rex: So oh, yes. YES. We HAVE ALREADY KINDA BEEN CONSIDERED OF "ESSENTANCE".
T-Rex: And we've discovered a way to ensure our senses don't forget!

T-Rex: BOOM!
