T-Rex: I am a guy who says "be strong, or the sword will not cut you down!" a lot.

T-Rex: Guys!

T-Rex: And I really value our friendship, even though I spent the better part of the last decade working on projects to build a stronger, more mature Dromiceiomimus for her. We built a bridge, and I live in a place and time that is ready to provide.

Utahraptor: And you value our friendship, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Our friendship, yeah!

Utahraptor: We're both ultra-competent dudes, and we both spent the better part of the last decade working on building one of the most powerful swords in the land. Shouldn't we be saying now?
T-Rex: WE MET FOR EXCHANGE, UTAHRAPTOR??
Utahraptor: T-Rex, we have different opinions over how strong your opinions should be.

T-Rex: Utahraptor, mine are more positive! Mine is more negative, and mine is more insane. Mine is more DISTINCTIVE. Mine is more DEPRESSING. Mine is more TERRIBLE. Mine is more UNFULFACTORY. Mine is more MISLEADING. Mine is more UNTIL NOW.
T-Rex: Oh wait I forgot that part!
T-Rex: MY TAX PROBLEMS REALLY GETFUL SO BAD
