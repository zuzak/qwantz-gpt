T-Rex: I just realized that I have some pretty terrible friends!

T-Rex: It's my tradition not to tell jokes about bad friends, okay??

T-Rex: So here's something for us, Dromiceiomimus: tell us about our bad friendships.  Our friendship's name?  THIS: NAME.
Dromiceiomimus: It's my friend, T-Rex.  She's a model.
T-Rex: Hah hah! How's that?

T-Rex: She's a model okay?
Utahraptor: Okay, so let's say your friend has a pet pterodactyl.  Okay, here's something for you, T-Rex: tell us about your pet pterodactyl.

T-Rex: Okay, here's something for you: tell us about your pet pterodactyl AND its friends.
T-Rex: Okay!  Okay, here's something for us to laugh about dumb things like dog poop or getting shot: maybe your friend's dog poop?

Utahraptor: Well, it's your turn to be magnanimous, so here's something for you, T-Rex: YOUR FAVOURITE DREAMS.
T-Rex: My favorite is my friend's... tub?
Utahraptor: T-Rex!  Can I bite into your homemade peanut butter?
T-Rex: Um, MY favorite is your tub?

Narrator: NEXT WEEK: T-REX DECIDES TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE KEEP SAYING THEIR NAME AT ALL TIMES; THERE WILL BE NO THANKS
T-Rex: Aw - hah - hah!
T-Rex: IT'S GOOD TO LEARN ABOUT IT, DROMICEIOMIMUS
