T-Rex: I have recently acquired some unsettling souvenirs.

T-Rex: These are the T-Rex Res! 

T-Rex: These were the T-Rex's who went to the dentist when they could, and who always forgave the wrong guy! 
T-Rex: Sometimes they even went to the dentist in the wrong house!
T-Rex: Sometimes they killed theMosquito that lives in the same hole as the dentist's chair!

Utahraptor: T-Rex, these are the same thing!
T-Rex: I know, it's crazy!

T-Rex: But they represent the fun times!  The dentist always remembers how to kill snakes!  The guy who invented the family name that is, in fact, very close to complete science is always impressed with his staff's skill! 
Utahraptor: I actually think we're in for the sequel.
T-Rex: Really?

Narrator: LATER, T-REX IS UPDATING HIS FICTIONAL MURDER FICTIONALLY. 
T-Rex: He always says "I think the staff at the dentist are the worst possible thing that could happen to a scientist's name!!"
T-Rex: Then I overdose and have a coma for like a decade!
