T-Rex: I've changed my mind! By changing my mind, you can LEGALLY get instant mashed potatoes!

T-Rex: They're still delicious, just not in a literal sense!

T-Rex: But I've made a few changes to it: the mashed potatoes are now named after me, if you will!
Dromiceiomimus: "My name is Dromiceiomimus and I am a fan of mashed potatoes."
T-Rex: "Oh yeah? Sweet! Check it out!"

Utahraptor: "Turn to 3: the afterlife"
T-Rex: Turn to 3: the afterlife??

T-Rex: Dude, you should probably go back to your basics class right away!! The afterlife is a magical place where the dead stayed for thousands of years before coming back, so right now your memories of that place are likely wrong and boring. Also, the afterlife is open to everyone, so you can wander around freely.

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: So! Utahraptor, where the heck are my classes?
Utahraptor: Huh?
T-Rex: Where are you ?
T-Rex: I'm in the backroom of science fiction author Steve Klosterman !
