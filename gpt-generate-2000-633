Narrator: T-REX'S FLAVOURIZED EXCHANGE COMICS
T-Rex: It's delicate, I think. It's time to...

T-Rex: ...change my life entirely?

T-Rex: Change everything. The thing I love about myself is that I have no friends. Oh yes. I am so alone. And yet, I have so much to offer.
Dromiceiomimus: You're talking about your sexual orientation?
T-Rex: I'm talking only to myself.

Utahraptor: Well, it's your loss here, T-Rex, but it is a gain.
T-Rex: Thank you!

T-Rex: I find it encouraging. I gain the confidence to live my life according to the beliefs and values that I have while I remain pure.
Utahraptor: Okay.
T-Rex: I'm going to take it back.
