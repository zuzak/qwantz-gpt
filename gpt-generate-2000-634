T-Rex: There's a lot of horses in my life and they're all shy and cheezed off at me.

T-Rex: I want to be one of them!

T-Rex: But I also want to have adventures in them.  I want to learn more about them and get some of their adventures explained in convincing them to ride me!
Dromiceiomimus: Horses have personalities!  If you don't like it, set it "Free Song From The Radio" and get some of its lyrics used in your story!
T-Rex: That's what makes them so special!

Utahraptor: I see no reason why we couldn't work out a script!
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Horses have personalities, right?  If you don't like it, set it "Free Song From The Radio" and have some of its lyrics used in your story!
T-Rex: That's what makes horses so special!

T-Rex: If you don't like it, set it "Life Is A Funtime for Playing With Scissors" and have some of its lyrics used in your story!
Utahraptor: That's what makes horses so special!
T-Rex: If you don't like it, get some of its lyrics from Mark-Paul Gosselaar's Comedy Club, and have them used in your story!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hi Utahraptor! Can you help us figure out a way to make horses... SO SPECIAL?
Utahraptor: Our last, best and only hope is to be one of the places where they're at.
T-Rex: And let me just say, "Thank you!"
