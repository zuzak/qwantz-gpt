T-Rex: There's this conundrum that we all find ourselves in. If I buy some speaker parts, will they last a long time? If they fail to last a long time, will they explode when I plug them in? All I can say is I want the piece now, but I want it for SHAME.

T-Rex: It won't last forever.

T-Rex: Plasticizers will explode when you remove them, but that's only a possibility and you should expect future generations to choose the better parts.
Dromiceiomimus: I also want replacements that last only a few seconds and don't explode, but that don't require plugging them in.
T-Rex: Yes. Plasticizers do work well enough.

Utahraptor: But then I'd be left wondering what the heck they've got inside them, and if they even need that to charge!
T-Rex: What? No!

Utahraptor: Well, if that's what you want, then I suppose you could consider a change of scenery.
T-Rex: What? No!
Utahraptor: Well, if that's what you want, then I suppose you could consider a change of scenery.

T-Rex: No WAY, Utahraptor! You already said that.
T-Rex: You already did!
T-Rex: NO
T-Rex: I'm now realizing that no matter how hard I try, this one plasticizer I just bought doesn't last very long
