T-Rex: Okay I'm done with my love stories. I'm done with worrying about who can kiss whom and when I can't get married and where I can legally marry someone just because of their race.

T-Rex: They're more interesting!

T-Rex: My true interest in life and marriage began several years ago, when I met a woman named "Candace" for reasons that will soon become clear. We were engaged! Like she!
T-Rex: Sweet!
T-Rex: I met her at a party!

T-Rex: We ended up kissing, which was not unexpected! I do not know why we were kissing, but I thought maybe I was attracted to her because of her skin tone, like we both were.
Dromiceiomimus: That's true.
T-Rex: I guess it was a good thing we had skin tones, huh?

Utahraptor: Yeah, it was a good thing.
T-Rex: Yeah, but it wasn't the whole story.

T-Rex: It wasn't the whole story. We had sex on the couch, and then she put her hands on the edge of the bed, reached up and moved them, kissed us, and when she reached up to her hand, I noticed she was making out. It was pretty gross.
Utahraptor: I love how now you're pushing the boundaries of what's acceptable, but I guess she was still there.

T-Rex: I love how she's moving her legs, but he's not moving them.
T-Rex: I love that at the end I mention that. 
T-Rex: Oh my god!
T-Rex: Wow!
T-Rex: Wow
T-Rex: THAT was probably the last time I'd imagine that we'd be having sex.
