T-Rex: Okay, so there's that one time in history when humans were really, really ordinary. There's a time when people worked as farmhands, picking fruit from a field and using specialized hands. There's a time when people made cell phones and threw them away for scrap!

T-Rex: That's what happened to me!

T-Rex: And that's one reason I came up with this awesome story idea. I wanted a past-time version of history that wouldn't have all the crazy twists and turns. I wanted something original, unfiltered, but also exciting, and nostalgic.
Dromiceiomimus: What happened to the farmhands?
T-Rex: Oh well!

Utahraptor: What happened to you?
T-Rex: I stayed in tofberlast, but I built a new factory there!

T-Rex: I've reconstructed MY very own farm there, and we're GREAT. The land has been cultivated for over 50 years and has been used for industrial-sized explosions of colour! I've even invented a special cream to blow any outside observer's imagination away.
Utahraptor: Wow.

Narrator: LATER, T-REX IS LOGIC'S EDUTRON'S FAULT:
T-Rex: Excuse me, Sir? I don't have a video game console.
T-Rex: I was referring to a movie?
T-Rex: ... 
T-Rex: Yes! 
T-Rex: It's brilliant
