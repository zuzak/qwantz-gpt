T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate way to be totally in control of my life!  Here's my ultimate plan for being totally in control of my life!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus! Let's go to the beach!

T-Rex: I plan to be totally pooched, you guys! It will be so SO GOOD. We'll ALL go and be secluded, staring at the beach, while a group of INTIMATE WOMEN go and get some sun! Then we'll get to go and be all sexy and sexy, at the end!
Dromiceiomimus: That certainly seems to be the plan.
T-Rex: I CAN'T WAIT. I BET WE ARE CURRENTLY TAKING OUR OWN LIFE AND WANT TO BE THE GUY WHO WANTS ALL THE CANDIDATES.

Utahraptor: So you want to be the guy who gets sunburned, but just then gets sunburned!
T-Rex: Do I want to?

T-Rex: Get a prescription? Give it to me, Utahraptor! The end!
Utahraptor: I do not!
T-Rex: Really? Really? Well, I mean, I do, but they make the decision that it's best for you to take the medicine rather than the person!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX IS KINDA MAKING ALL THE CANDIDATES:
T-Rex: Guys! Do you want to get a prescription for "body shape" and "body shape" and "body shape" AND "body shape" AND "body shape" and "body shape"??
T-Rex: I will!
