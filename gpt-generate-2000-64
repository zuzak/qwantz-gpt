T-Rex:  Hello!  I am a new dude who has not had the best of times this week!

T-Rex:  So.  I'm going to try to make up for it by making up for losing some of these some of these days!

T-Rex:  So, um... I'm going to go sledding down the side of a mountain, Dromiceiomimus.  Dromiceiomimus.  Dromiceiomimus.  Dromiceiomimus.  Dromiceiomimus.  Dromiceiomimus.  Dromiceiomimus.  Dromiceiomimus.  Dromiceiomimus.  Dromiceiomimus.  Dromiceiomimus.

Utahraptor:  That's a metaphor.  Isn't it?
T-Rex:  It's  GOOD Sarcasm, my friend!

T-Rex:  It's full of little words that say "stranded" or "stuck" or "sanded" or "woke", but then the words are so small that you can imagine how small they are.  They represent just a tiny sliver of our affection!
Utahraptor:  ...

T-Rex:  Yesssss!
Utahraptor:  And now, I'll let Utahraptor have it!  His rule is the best ever, and it includes using words that rhyme with our words and therefore carry weight!
T-Rex:  Man!
T-Rex:  Words you never use to describe someone you've just met
