T-Rex: Oh man...is it REALLY that bad of a phrase?

T-Rex: I mean, it's not actually that bad of a phrase, but I think we're both aware that it could be so!

T-Rex: We make love, right?
T-Rex: And we make love, and then we get married, right?
T-Rex: This is the REAL deal, Dromiceiomimus!

T-Rex: The WORDS ARE WASTED.
Utahraptor: Sex worker!

Utahraptor: I know that it's amazing, but I just think that it's wasteful and inefficient. Why are we spending our money on a single item when we could rather emphasize the positive?
T-Rex: Why are we putting this same thought into a new baby?

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Oh my gosh, it's SO GOOD, Utahraptor! It's like a toy for the new baby!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, it's so wonderful!
T-Rex: Haha, what are you talking about?
Utahraptor: WELL, it's a great use of our precious time!
T-Rex: Wow, you've shown me your precious time!
