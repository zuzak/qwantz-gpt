T-Rex: I have received complaints. Yesterday was the worst day ever for a "office phone call".

T-Rex: I am going to correct people!

T-Rex: Okay, the first complaint is "the dirt's hot there for someone who makes them call their 'mate' 'mate' simply because he or she can't get a WHILE longer phone call to hand".
T-Rex: I am going to correct people on that one.

Utahraptor: The second complaint is "my old phone is way too cold and my ex-girlfriend is totally jealous of me because I've said she's had better things to do than go to jail for being single".

T-Rex: I'm going to correct people on those two very important points!
Utahraptor: Yes!

T-Rex: But the third and final complaint is "my ex-girlfriend is totally into me now and she keeps calling because I keep her in the dark about what's really going on - and now she's jealous".
Utahraptor: Yes.
T-Rex: THAT last one's for naught!  I should have said "excuse me, T-Rex, but do you recall when you and I went to sleep last night? Do you think maybe I should be talking to God now, he's going to call and I'm going to play him some cards; hold on, I'm going to hold you till he's 70".

T-Rex: These cards are going to be important, therefore they're no longer needed; they're no longer needed; I must make amends now!!
T-Rex: Wait! THIS card is going to be a big thing in my life, so make amends now!!
