Narrator: THE DAY DROMICEIOMIMUS INVITED PEOPLE TO A PARTY TOO EARLY
T-Rex: Yes! I will now describe the day DROMICEIOMIMUS INVITED PEOPLE PARTIED TO A PARTY TOO EARLY.

Narrator: IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD THE SCENIC CURE AND DON'T WANT TO BE MADE OF, then this day is not very creative!
T-Rex: Don't tell my mom my story!!

T-Rex: IT'S TRUE.  But it's also not very exciting.
Utahraptor: We've got some bad news, T-Rex!

T-Rex: The cure for all diseases is social!  We're not going to date someone from another social group.  We can still date some socialites from CHESS.
Utahraptor: But you're inviting socialites from another social group to PARTIES that are taking place inside buildings that are EASILY decorated for CHRISTIANS.
T-Rex: THAT IS A MUCH LESS CREEPY T-REX STORY, PLEASE.

Narrator: AND YOU ARE SOLVING ALL THE PROBLEMS
T-Rex: YES I DID
Narrator: THE END
