T-Rex: When I was a child I used to go to the fair!

T-Rex: I would always pout!

T-Rex: I could see myself running to and fro at the time, so that's pretty much guaranteed to the max.

T-Rex: But it wasn't until I was old enough that I thought about it.  And while I myself have chequed... MAN, there are countless online scams where the sender promises to pay the cheque within ten minutes of the word being announced, which I guess is still considered an act?

Utahraptor: I still think that's a pretty classy thing to do!
T-Rex: It's not! It's not like I'm going to pull it off.

T-Rex: What I want is someone who's as classy as possible. Someone who will do anything for a small fee.
Utahraptor: There's a lot I don't know about being a nice person!
T-Rex: Oh man!!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Huh!
T-Rex: It was on purpose!
