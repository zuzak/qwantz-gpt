Narrator: T-REX IN: "WRAPPING PRESENTS IN YOUR BODY"
T-Rex: There's nothing wrong with a man going through life at a good pace!

T-Rex: We should all get off our couches and get off our couches as soon as possible, Dromiceiomimus! We need to get off our couches as soon as possible.
Dromiceiomimus: Okay T-Rex, why don't we do that NOW?
T-Rex: No, we need to do that by the next morning.  NOW.

Utahraptor: What?  Suddenly you're pushing yourself while also being gentle with Dromiceiomimus.
T-Rex: I pushed myself while also being gentle with Dromiceiomimus!

T-Rex: I know, it sucks, but it seems to be a daily thing.  I should get off my couches and get off my goddamned anagramments as soon as possible.
Utahraptor: Okay.  Then I'm going to push myself back into a comfortable couch so I can get off that one.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Whew!!
T-Rex: Guys, did I just say that I appreciative and a great listener is totally awesome??
