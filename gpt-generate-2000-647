T-Rex: I have been thinking, and I have come up with the perfect solution to the problem of my being considered, by others, to be "cute".

T-Rex: I will become "cute Adult Time"

T-Rex: This is the perfect solution to the daily grind of life.  I will get to bed early, look every morning, and forget about the challenge!
Dromiceiomimus: So uh, you don't mind if you look hungry, do you?
T-Rex: Weeeey, you take care of me!

Utahraptor: T-Rex! You really haven't thought this through yet!
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yeah, I thought maybe you were too busy to consider the bigger picture! Hmm... this, my friend, is a very good idea.
T-Rex: Really! I've got to think about this for a while.
