T-Rex: I've been thinking...

T-Rex: I've been thinking outside the box, and inside the box I've got a very permissive T-Rex!

T-Rex: It's a very permissive thing to say, because it implies that I'm just trying to box people in to make things easier for them!  I'm just being myself, and therefore I'm way more permissive with my words than I should be.
T-Rex: Plus, it means that if I say "dude check out this hot stud", people will say, "Dude check out this hot stud!"

Utahraptor: So what do they say?
T-Rex: "Check out this hot stud?"

T-Rex: "Is that what is hot today?"
Utahraptor: Um "A very hot dude"?
T-Rex: "Would you like to have a hott show off his skills today?"
Utahraptor: "As you wish?"
T-Rex: "I wish I was God, because I don't think I am!"

T-Rex: "I'm sorry to be your friend but I am NOT God," he said.
T-Rex: "Examination of the person is of value," he added.
