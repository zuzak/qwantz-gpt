T-Rex: I am a guy who has a lot of disposable income. If I spend all my disposable income on ads selling toothbrushes, that would only cost $3.50 - about the same as buying a used toothbrush! And if I spend more on television ads, that'll likely cost less, but the percentage of my disposable income going to good things eventually might decline!

T-Rex: I call this the "tyranny of the few" theory!

T-Rex: It says that when there's a severe drop in social spending, those bad things tend to happen more often than not. But what happens when there's a large gain? And what does the government do? When interest rates are raised once more, that usually leads to more good things happening.

Utahraptor: That's the "tyranny of the few".
T-Rex: Oh my God!

T-Rex: Well, that's definitely true! But government spending often doesn't equal good.
Utahraptor: How so?
T-Rex: Sometimes good things happen to bad things, but there's no equal footing.

T-Rex: It can be nice to say "I took a small fortune and made things larger things" and not really care at all.
Utahraptor: Doesn't that make you sound awesome?
T-Rex: More awesome...
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!
T-Rex: [[Thinking]] More things larger things things things things things things
