T-Rex: I have come into possession of several kilograms of gold.

T-Rex: Truly, I have acquired Classical Metaphors.

T-Rex: It is a great deal more than a goldsmith would spend in a savings account. It is PRETTY GOOD. Furthermore, it is almost identical to real gold, in that you can now spend it in non-negative terms. Hey, if you own 10 kilograms of gold than OK, now's a chance I'm throwing some money at you!  Screw you to the curb!

Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex?
T-Rex: ATTENTION, MASTURBERS NEVER CONSUME MY GOLD!

Utahraptor: As long as the metal remains of a metal given shape and mass, no gold can ever enter the system.
T-Rex: Really? That means the gold you're now holding is nothing more than a metal with a mass approximating that of a glass. The only question is how precisely this system works: does it allow us to accurately identify and mine precious metal remains?

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE FUTURE:
T-Rex: The world will mine us precious metal!
Utahraptor: I mean, mine me more precious metal!
T-Rex: Really? That means the world, as a whole, should mine us precious metal.
