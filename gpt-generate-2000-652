T-Rex: The first law of thermodynamics -

T-Rex: The LAW OF RHYTHM!

T-Rex: Let us all be aware of laws of thermodynamics, Dromiceiomimus. Let us, in unison, exercise some control!
Dromiceiomimus: Um, T-Rex, that's a pretty okay law, because it rules out suffering the effects of an all-you-can-eat-here dystopian-era utopia??
T-Rex: Oh. Um, that's actually pretty awesome, Dromiceiomimus.

Utahraptor: The second law of thermodynamics -

T-Rex: The LAW OF OHIO!
Utahraptor: Oh no!
T-Rex: I'm not impressed! I'm actually... going to call some classes?

Utahraptor: Dude, you're not going to be impressed, even with actual law.
T-Rex: But it's gonna be awesome! We'll get together and have some questions, and be like "Man, we should all get old and move to a new townhouse in order to live in less wastelands!"
Utahraptor: That - that actually sounds like a real good idea!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Question period's over Utahraptor!
T-Rex: That's the sentence printout!
