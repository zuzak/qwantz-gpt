Narrator: HOW TO BLUFF YOUR WAY THROUGH EVERY CONVERSATION ABOUT FLOUR STICKS
T-Rex: There are many different kinds of flour, and it's hard to say which one is the best!

T-Rex: But flour is WEIRD!

T-Rex: It's composed of a non-toxic base, called "finely brix" (meaning "finely"). But there's a third, cheaper, option: brixic flour. It's composed of unstable amounts of trace elements, like "finely"s, but still! Um, pretty stable!
T-Rex: It's also somewhat unstable in nature, isn't it?

Utahraptor: Okay, so how do we measure flour?
T-Rex: Well, the FAO has poured flour into tiny balls, and that flour ball measures about 50 microns wide x 50 microns deep!

T-Rex: That's pretty much exactly the amount of room in our bodies if flour doesn't reach a usable shape overnight. So, hey, our bodies are for science! They're for pranksters, of course!
T-Rex: Also: they're for REAL people who are going to go on a date.
