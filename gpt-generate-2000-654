T-Rex:  Hello and welcome to  Jeopardy, a reality show for adults that also seems to be having a big effect on kids.  I'm really looking forward to this particular episode.

T-Rex:  Also, here's a picture of me with my friends if I win the bet, or if I don't, give them a second chance.

T-Rex:  The money will go to charity instead of ads!

T-Rex:  The more people in a room with me, the better charity is!  It means more money is being made.  And I'm giving you the pictures, because I think this bet will be very interesting.
Dromiceiomimus:  I'm giving you the pictures, T-Rex.
T-Rex:  Yes.  Here they are.

T-Rex:  Enjoy this special!
Utahraptor:  Thank you!

Utahraptor:  Also, if you win this bet, you'll get a printed copy of my song, "Saving Grace".
T-Rex:  Oh yeah?  You can buy that as a gift.  I thought there was a way I could win.
Utahraptor:  I see.

T-Rex:  HELLO, GUYS, you guys are way better than that
T-Rex:  HELLO
T-Rex:  GUESS
T-Rex:  THE BEST
