T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate foolproof way to win back your sweetie(!): a Facebook page!!

T-Rex: NOW YOU HAVE TO BUY YOUR WAY TO WIN

T-Rex: Don't you dare! Facebook is like a website you'll want to log onto, but isn't really you; you need your website to get started if you want your name to get started.  So here's how you'll get started:  visit a site like...  SERIOUSLY??  Google is a site you can use to find links to images and other related resources; Facebook uses a similar format but is loaded from scratch.  If your website can be found by chance, SERIOUSLY WEIRD.  Don't even think about making it Facebook; you've probably just wanted to visit one of the sites.

T-Rex: Once you've got your website up and running, make sure you have everything you'll need: a website card, YOU'RE in luck!!  Right now your Facebook account is only used for this.  If it gets flooded with fake accounts you can just take it down, but I doubt you'll be long for this day!

Utahraptor: So get your website up and running quickly!
T-Rex: Yes!  As of today's version, yes!!

T-Rex: So, instead of a link to our Facebook page, you'll need your own page.  And that means you need a website card that says, "SERIOUSLY I'M IN FAVOUR OF THIS IF I'M SURE THIS MAY HAVE A PARTICULARLY INTEREST, UTAHRAPTOR?"
Utahraptor: ANYONE can make a website, right?
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: And if you really don't know what "site" is, make a link to our INSTITUTE, which is our place where you'll find our books, articles, advice on all things infidels, pictures of us and stuff.  Also make sure your website card says "SERIOUSLY I'M IN FAVOUR OF THIS IF YOU'RE GETTING TWITTER ADVICE".
T-Rex: We've had better sites for that than yours!!
