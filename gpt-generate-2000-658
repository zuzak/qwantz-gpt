Narrator: THINGS THAT MATTERED ME
T-Rex: I don't like it when my friend or dog gets bit.

T-Rex: It shocks me!

T-Rex: It's like - what if I didn't like it? What if I didn't like the whole thing? I don't want to be with someone who doesn't like what they're doing, who doesn't follow the nutritional rules of the road, who doesn't follow the WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE IN FOOD??

Utahraptor: Well, you're probably thinking, "ah, that sucks!"
T-Rex: But it's not a big thing!  We could grow out of the problem in some way, allowing the new friend to flow like a balloon, without any problems!

T-Rex: But that's not my idea of a friendship, Utahraptor. All I'm trying is a recipe for nourishment.
Utahraptor: What if you didn't like what you were eating?
T-Rex: Disaster!  Someone's got to eat your food and get away with it.
T-Rex: It's totally possible that one day someone will eat your food, but for sure, ensure your own well-being!  Don't be sad!
