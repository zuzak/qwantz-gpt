T-Rex: Time to go back in time and visit the CRADLE OF CIVIC HAIR.  I'm back 200 years!

Narrator: BACK IN TIME 200 YEARS
T-Rex: Huh!

T-Rex: Even though we're traveling in an airplane the exact time we wanted to visit was just a - matter of figuring out what time period to visit, we're UNLOCKED.  The WHATEVER, Dromiceiomimus, we are GONE.
Dromiceiomimus: May I go visit the CRADLE OF CIVIC HAIR?
T-Rex: Sure can!  I'm back now 200 years from now, and that's just to visit the sites of the great civilizations that lived during MY time!

Utahraptor: Wait - what happened to the time machine?
T-Rex: That one was a wreck!

T-Rex: I need to get the hell out of here before anyone else does either.  I don't want to be the guy who's 2000 years late.
Utahraptor: Okay, well, you're coming back in time 200 years from now, so you're likely to fall back to the exact same time period.

T-Rex: That's correct, my friend!  If I use the exact time period from now, I'm back in time 200 years from now.
Utahraptor: Prove to me you're the only one that can do that!
T-Rex: I will!
