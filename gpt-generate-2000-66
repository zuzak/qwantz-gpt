T-Rex: I'm not saying that people who say "rare" in all the correct circumstances are not tantalizingly tantalizingly tantalizingly tantalizingly DISASTER SHOOTING SHOOTERS.

Narrator: "CUTE" COMICS

T-Rex: I've got some really exciting ideas to tell you today, Dromiceiomimus! "RARE" in all the right circumstances means exactly what "I bought myself a nice boat and drove me around the world" have all happened!
Dromiceiomimus: I don't see a boat to buy a boat.
T-Rex: Why do you think boats are the way to go?

Utahraptor: You're on the record saying "rare", my friend!
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: No, I'm not. There's only one way to find out! You just need to ask me.
T-Rex: Okay. Well. Since this is the only way I can find out about THESE events, I'm going to assume you're the only person alive.

Narrator: "DID YOU KNOW"
T-Rex: Oh, it was actually a big help having a good conversation about them, a fact I'm not really sure I quite got through. Anyway!
T-Rex: Man!
T-Rex: 'Cause I'll definitely need to ask my friends what's happening.
