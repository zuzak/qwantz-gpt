T-Rex: Dudes!  There are a bunch of raccoons in my little cabin.

T-Rex: They eat my carrots!

T-Rex: I wonder which one ate which one?  Well, seriously, there must be some animals that ate these creepy pets. 
Dromiceiomimus: They never forgave!
T-Rex: I know, right?  Well, there must be some animals that did. 

Utahraptor: T-Rex, are you honestly investigating your own animal behaviour?
T-Rex: Sure am.

T-Rex: But wouldn't it be COOL to take the time between interviews to determine if any animals you encounter have an effect on your life? 
Utahraptor: No, because the conversation could be LIES. 
T-Rex: Wait, I heard you were investigating your own animals...

T-Rex: ... before I made the friggin' decision?
