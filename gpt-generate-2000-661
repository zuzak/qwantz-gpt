T-Rex: Friends, if I were wearing a mask I'd never be friends with a mask wearer, you know?
T-Rex: I'm not one to be bickering; I just want to be friends!!

T-Rex: But it occurs to me that the vast majority of people I know (and care about) have unblinkingly preserved the mask-wearing powers of a child.  They look like adults and have no inner workings other than the simple joy of seeing one's maskstyself interacting with the mask-wearing public.

Utahraptor: I was thinking more about self-care and control?
T-Rex: Well, more so than that!

T-Rex: It's a necessary condition to have when we're all -  so to speak - and I therefore decided to make the Foundation a non-profit organization.  The purpose of the Foundation is to support the people in need, and to serve as a hub for that need.
Utahraptor: That's awesome!  It's why people keep coming to me when needed.
T-Rex: That's why. . . it's such a good thing.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE FUTURE:
T-Rex: hey t-rex!  my name is t-rex and i'm pretty cool!  um, what's up
T-Rex: Oh, my pulse was pounding for a second there, but there wasn't actually a pulse for you right now
