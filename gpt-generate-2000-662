T-Rex: So the Rajasaurus got tired of eating and spent his stomach pumped for food. After about five days it developed a severe case of stomach cramps. He was sent back in time to about 50 years ago to give the old saying, "Don't judge a dog! If it doesn't eat you, it ate ME!"

T-Rex: People loved him!

T-Rex: Among the comments on his diary was "Remember Rajasaurus? Remember you should give this guy a try!"
Dromiceiomimus: Was he a friend?
T-Rex: Yep! He was a friend of mine who thought his friends were making some joke about how if you eat you'll die!

Utahraptor: That's pretty clever, my friend!
T-Rex: It's true!

T-Rex: I don't know, man, but I do like the idea of this. Suppose a man experiences stomach pains 100 years later.
Utahraptor: Then he's dead!
T-Rex: And this is to say that he's a hero, because he did something so responsible that even the very scientists who recorded his every waking moment did the same. They discovered that his stomach pains were independent of how often he ate. Put that in a few hundred years, and you've got a guy who was, in a sense, a saint.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX IS GOING ON HIS SCIENCE ADVENTURE:
T-Rex: Well, I was just wondering if anyone has contacted me to tell me how they found out I'm not a hero?
T-Rex: I'm gonna call Professor Science!
