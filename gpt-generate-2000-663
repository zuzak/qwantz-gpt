T-Rex: Let us start with the assumption that talking about the issues around the issue of slavery in the industrialized developed world is somehow less popular than talking about the issues around the issue of slavery in the non developed world!

T-Rex: Everyone seems to like it!

T-Rex: But I worry that this has robbed us of a chance to discuss these important issues in a frank and straightforward manner.  Slavery is a thing that's not popular, and it's getting harder and harder to get people to like it.  I worry that this is compounded by the fact that there's not enough people to talk about these issues in.  When I talk about slavery in the industrializedated world, I really only talk about things that affect people in the ways I want!  I'm sorry!  We have ways of doing that."

Utahraptor: But some things are better than others!
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: But I'm troubled by the fact that SOMETIMES, conversations about slavery are now: rare, marginal, and even nonexistent.  On the one hand, we (as a people) are more comfortable talking about the issues involved here, and these conversations are now being done in ways that are not only more accessible, but also more accessible for all!

T-Rex: On the other hand, I can't help but feel that we've politicized these issues, and that these conversations should never be politicized at all.
T-Rex: I'm glad we're having these conversations, and I'm glad we're having these people politicize these issues.
