T-Rex: It turns out that there's a downside to being a Utahraptor! Being a farmer costs YOU money. You move with your own money and your own money. And THAT money is going to be better used for better things, like more vegetables for your family?

T-Rex: For some it actually is!

T-Rex: And while we're at it, we ALSO need to decide what's worth doing for a given period of time. That's what we're going to be doing with our lives right now!
Utahraptor: Why?

T-Rex: What if we had some special circumstances that decided farming was worth doing for a reason, as none of us had anything worth doing for free?  And wouldn't that be a good thing?  We'd end up killing some birds to avoid being killed by this madness.  You know?
Utahraptor: Yeah, it would be a good use of your time.

T-Rex: Sure, but what if I wasn't really sure what worth doing for a given period of time was worth doing? I don't want to be that guy who ends up starving, but who then eventuallydies.
T-Rex: That's what I'm going to say.
T-Rex: Goodbye, Utahraptor.
