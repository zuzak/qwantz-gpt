T-Rex: The problem with Superman (or Batman, depending on what you mean by that) is that his super-speed isn't that fast.

T-Rex: Sure, he can hit things with his fists!

T-Rex: But if you're going to award a character with the ability to hit things with his fists, you need limbs. Hands! Bridges! Bridges all point to this being a metaphor, but if you're going to award a character with a brain that's INTELLING, then I don't know what to think.
T-Rex: Bridges all point to Bridges all pointing to his fists!

Utahraptor: Well, I'm glad we're friends, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Our friendship all comes down to this!

T-Rex: Bridges all point to the fact that if you don't have fists, things get hairy!
Utahraptor: I'd argue our friendship points to this being a metaphor, only we don't actually use it that often.

T-Rex: Dude, I'm not MAKING this up! I'm not even including the fact that using words like "shabby" or "invented" in an unrelated but similarly named article as a basis for argument seems to be out of sorts.
T-Rex: Aww, remember?
