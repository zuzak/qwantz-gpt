T-Rex: When a superhero invents a costume, they usually CHOOSE not to go through with it. It's called a "mistake", and is, at its core, just representing a deviation from the norm. Mistakes happen because we don't follow the rules, and because we don't follow the rulesDromiceiomimus: So what's the solution?

T-Rex: More mistries?

T-Rex: They try mistreating the rules again, but again. They try to get rid of the rule about not mistreating the rules, but they fail. Mistakes multiply.
Utahraptor: Mistries multiply!
T-Rex: Yeah, and that means we should do something about it! Like legalize marijuana?

Utahraptor: Solve it! Legalize it now, legalize it when it's legal! Nobody put the same label on it then as we did with mistries.
T-Rex: Maybe we could define a new word, more appropriately, called 'MTV'

T-Rex: It's a fun word to use if you want to teach kids that once applied to them, they're kids, and they should be taught before you apply it?
T-Rex: Can't we all just agree that more movies is the charm for drowning kids in failed romantic comedies? PLEASE.
