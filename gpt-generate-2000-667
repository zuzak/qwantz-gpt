Narrator: T-REX HAS WRITTEN A STORY ABOUT A DOG THAT GETS SUPER POWERS
T-Rex: It's terrible!

T-Rex: We live in a world where our most basic desires are expressed through the use of a singular and necessary artificial intelligences.  How can this be?  If I had a dog, it would be able to express ALL OF MY COUSIN' WELFARE!!

T-Rex: It's terrible!
Utahraptor: Hey, what's terrible?

T-Rex: It's what happens when I forget my dentist's bill!  My dog will accidentally eat a lot of canned fish, and then my heart will stop and I'll be like "Man, what the hell, my dog is extremely capacity and therefore not enough energy" and then I'll be all "Ouch, Sir!!"
Utahraptor: T-Rex, that's terrible!

T-Rex: It's so terrible!  I can hear you out, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: You're the worst!
T-Rex: I'm the worst!!
T-Rex: I've never listened to "Please be it" by a Utahraptor!!
