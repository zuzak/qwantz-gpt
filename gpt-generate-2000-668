T-Rex: I had the strangest dream last night...

T-Rex: It was crazy!

Dromiceiomimus: Whoo!
T-Rex: But it was also surreal.  It was this disconnect with reality: the dream of a dream, this blank, blank space in which we could not really make out what was going on.  And it was as if dreams were trying to take over the world, trying to take over our lives!
Dromiceiomimus: It was an amazing realization, huh?

Utahraptor: Well, it was dream after dream, right?
T-Rex: Right!

T-Rex: But it was also the dream of infiltration, of adventure, of looking for something to do.
Utahraptor: Yeah, and of going back and looking for some more freedom and freedom and finding your own home in this strange place, where you have been (quite literally)!

T-Rex: That's how dreams come to be!
T-Rex: My friends, my dream will be a world wide experience, with everything I've done finally being done in my dreams.
T-Rex: ...That's pretty amazing
