Narrator: THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ADULTS AND CHILDREN COMICS

Narrator: teens

T-Rex: So you were a kid when you were a kid, huh?
T-Rex: Just fine.
T-Rex: I'm fine.
T-Rex: I don't understand.

Utahraptor: Why are you telling this story, downplaying the differences between you and adults?
T-Rex: I was!

T-Rex: I had a few takers in high school, but now I'm downplaying the differences! I guess they were only there to witness one of my sex ed experiments, and that was me being a teen!
Utahraptor: I guess!

Narrator: THE YET REGULAR
T-Rex: Oh man, is this the Life Experiment with Tautological Adulthood ("LEPIEST"): THE MOST DEPRESSING ACTIVITY EVER IN TIME??
T-Rex: It's supposed to take you on an emotional rollercococo, and then you're home free, my friends.
T-Rex: You're invited to sex ed as "Life's a journeyman who ends everything he starts, and then a journeyman comes along and sucks all the joysmasks out of me, never even realizing he's suckin' them anyway"!
