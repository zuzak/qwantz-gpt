T-Rex: I used to be a guy who said "If there was one thing I had never had the chance to, it would be love."

T-Rex: Hah! TRUE.

T-Rex: But then I met someone I respect who just happens to have a similar interest in finding and loving someone else (w)orld!
T-Rex: Ohh! LOVE IS MACBETH'S.

Utahraptor: That's not entirely true!

Utahraptor: For one, it's more likely that you'll have the luck, and perhaps a stranger, to meet you at a party or a hustle. And two, it's more difficult to have the love and know that it's there, because there's usually not that many people interested in that person either way.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND:
T-Rex: Shakespeare! Are you listening to your MP3s again?
Shakespeare: I have
T-Rex: Yes!
T-Rex: Yes, wait
T-Rex: THIS is just kidding myself,

{{Shakespeare: i have long since recovered from the NMCTF, and while these may be my last words to me, they may also be that of a frustrated but wise man}}
