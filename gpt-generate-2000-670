Utahraptor: Bruce Wayne thinks Batman too.
T-Rex: Max Pickens thinks Batman is thinking of Batman too.
Utahraptor: Superman thinks Batman too.

T-Rex: Utahraptor turns to Batman and Utahraptor turns to Batman!
Utahraptor: Batman thinks Batman too.
T-Rex: Batman thinks Max Pickens is Superman, too.
T-Rex: Max Pickens thinks Batman is Superman too.
T-Rex: Batman runs to the side of the road, and behind him hangs a picture of Batman, wearing a Batman mask.
