T-Rex: I have received complaints. Apparently I can be a difficult person to complete.

T-Rex: Apparently!

T-Rex: Apparently Dromiceiomimus sent me a letter that says "Dear T-Rex, if you were still around then I would LOVE you for a whole bunch of reasons but seriously I still really want to hang out with you."
Dromiceiomimus: Huh.
T-Rex: I know! But I didn't write that! I didn't write that!

Utahraptor: I thought we had this tension!
T-Rex: Yeah, definitely.

T-Rex: I wrote that because I really want to hang out with you guys, and also because I want to spend more time with you guys, since I'm probably going to check your house and say "Hey T-Rex, what's your usual name again?"
Utahraptor: Huh.
T-Rex: That's cool, because we could still hang out!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hey, how is everything working out for my friend Rachel?
RACHEL NICHOLAS: Just fine!
T-Rex: Always doing what I want!
