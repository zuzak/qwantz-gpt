T-Rex: Well I'm really early, and the amount of time I've got is actually a function of my age, as measured by my ability to reach prime moiety!

T-Rex: Prime moiety is when you reach between two prime numbers a value that's at or near your ceiling.

T-Rex: It occurs to me that I could reach that ceiling quickly!

T-Rex: So my reference here is actually the opposite of the truth! If I could only fall into one of these three periods of my life, I strongly suggest you don't even be trying!
Dromiceiomimus: Teen pregnancy?
T-Rex: Teen pregnancy?

Utahraptor: You could also consider the issue of income, Teen pregnancy being a positive adult versus a negative adult situation, and conclude that there's some savings, yes?

Utahraptor: Yes you could, and so it's not really the sort of deal you should be making.
T-Rex: Well fine! I MAY or MAY not be the one to make this offer up as I age!

Narrator: THIS COMIC IS DEDICATED TO MY STYLE NUMBER.
T-Rex: Oh man!
T-Rex: My door's at the shoulder of my ass, you guys!
