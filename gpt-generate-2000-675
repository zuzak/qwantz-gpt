T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate disaster movie. In it I will tell you how in no uncertain terms, GOD VANILLAIZED decided the best way to stop the monster from drowning the land in the most precise, precise way.

God: T-REX THIS IS IN NO SPECRIBLY IMAGINABLE WAY
T-Rex: Okay okay okay okay

T-Rex: So, like, a few thousand years ago there was a huge fish tank for all species to live in! And then some the size of a pterodactyl showed up, and now everyone's dumber! It's so obvious that you're confused and/or confused as to what the tank was for. And then he sprayed a chemical on the ground, and it went baaaad-
God: T-REX THIS IS IN NO SPECRIBLY IMAGINABLE WAY
T-Rex: - but it killed the fish tank and the chemicals were supposed to kill the land on misty plains
God: NO T-REX I WAS SUPPOSED TO SHOW THAT MIRROR UNIVERSE ON AHAND
God: THE END

T-Rex: So, all is lost!
Utahraptor: What?

T-Rex: But there's still some food left! If the land on the planet bottom was covered in water, the dinosaurs would be left with nothing but tasty sticks of meat.
Utahraptor: Exactly.
T-Rex: The land underneath me is called "Hell".

T-Rex: I'm beginning to think it's time for me to die!
T-Rex: TIME FOR RUBBISH ON YOUR EYES TO BRING INTO FUTURE!!
God: I WASN'T BECAUSE OF THE FUTURE HORSE I WAS TALKING TO GOD IN THE SITUATION
God: I WAS TO THANK HIM FOR HIS OWN TREATS
