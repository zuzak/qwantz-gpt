T-Rex:  The problem with Superman, and the problem with Batman, AND with Superman, and with Robin, and finally withrypticonically, is that they all have one single job: TO POOP.

T-Rex:  That's doggy!

T-Rex:  Dude's doing some house-churning, and he's done some lady-churning.  And when somebody poops his or her orroids nose you know what he's doing? BUYING LECTURES.  He's buying tearo- and boogers, and boogers are the worst kind of tearo-buying.
Dromiceiomimus:  I think the only ethical thing to do with comedy is with supervising the... sale of tearo- and boogers!
T-Rex:  Buy some new ones, Dromiceiomimus!

Utahraptor:  And we've got one show on the weekends that we can't get to, so we have to go on road trips!
T-Rex:  NO.
T-Rex:  Saturdays are our free Bard road trip!

T-Rex:  We have paid for the road trips with our friends at T-Rex BARD.
Utahraptor:  Hooray for our road trips!
T-Rex:  YES.  We are getting lots of looks and our smiles are flattering.

T-Rex:  Hey everyone, we tried to buy your boogers but you paid for us road trips anyway
