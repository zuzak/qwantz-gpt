T-Rex: When I was a child I used to imagine that all my favourite things were cute little pictures I'd take with my friends, or rather coloured pages from the spookiest book of my favourite book, that I'd pick out and I could then put in my mouth!

T-Rex: That was way more fun than actually doing that!

T-Rex: I'd accidentally imagine that some of the things coloured pages are on my nose, and then my friends would start to worry that my kids will be drawn out of my books accidentally and then - horribly messed up in various degrees - while I'm away.

Utahraptor: That's actually pretty fun!
T-Rex: Pretty crazy!

T-Rex: And I think to this day I still imagine that it's true. Actually, I think in some ways I wish I had more control over what colours my friends would see, and I also wish I wouldn't always have the mean luck when it comes to coloured pages.
Utahraptor: I know!
T-Rex: You know - it's cool to imagine things that could be a little weird sometimes.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Aw man, am I still really good at imaginationting stuff like that??
