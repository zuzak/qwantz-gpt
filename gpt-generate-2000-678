T-Rex:  Hello  friends!  I am going to go over some things I've picked up since being friends!

T-Rex:  The first thing I learn is how to be a good friend!

T-Rex:  Observe, I am going to tell you one exciting fact about myself over the next few months!
Dromiceiomimus:  Woah, how perfect!
T-Rex:  Um, it's super perfect too!  It's super perfect.  It doesn't look or smell like my pooch.

Utahraptor:  I've never seen a retriever poop like that!
T-Rex:  Oh man!!

T-Rex:  How did I get so good at pooping?
Utahraptor:  I start when I was about five years old!
T-Rex:  I started when I was sixteen.
T-Rex:  Seven years later, I'd pooped out the roof of my house!

T-Rex:  And fifteen years later, I'd sent over the Christmas card I'd got when I was just a kid for your very sweet hearts, your sweetheartedness.
T-Rex:  *sigh*
T-Rex:  I tried to stop though, so that I might finally be able to stop being such a sucky person!!
