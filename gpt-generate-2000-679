T-Rex: I'm not a dude who has the best record with Christmas presents!  Or the best record with presents in general!  Or the rest of us don't get to enjoy the gifts we receive.  Or at least, the ones we don't get to enjoy.  It's just - we're not big into holidays when it's just folks we recognize.

T-Rex: I guess I'd better frig up before Christmas!

T-Rex: What I'm saying is this!                                  you can't be serious
T-Rex: Shoot, it's the Utahraptor's Special Event!

Utahraptor: Who's going to win?
T-Rex: The winner  will become the first person ever to purchase a ticket to celebrate a holiday, and he or she will also become the first person EVER to travel to a non-tourized holiday tourism agency, and in doing so, become the first person EVER TO START A BRAND NEW MARRIED LIFE!!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Wow, this anniversary party I started was CRAZY.  I got all the freebies AND the fake presents SO FASCINATING that the only people who were happy with me were some insanely handsome young men from Brazil.
T-Rex: They wanted to party with my REAL MASTER.
T-Rex: AW MAN!
T-Rex: I CAN'T EVEN GET LESS EMMA AND BABY
