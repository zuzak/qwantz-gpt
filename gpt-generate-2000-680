T-Rex: I have come up with the ULTIMATE MOTION WHALE COMICS STARSHIP. I will be all, "Now whate'est thou??"

T-Rex: Shot down?

T-Rex: I will shoot down, God!
God: GREETINGS T-REX I CAN IMAGINE YOUR MOM AND I WARN YOU IT IS TRULY RECEIVABLE
T-Rex: I WILL BE ALL, "YES, SHE WILL BE ALL, SO GO COMING!"
God: THAT'S SO MUCH FOR THE PAST T-REX WHAT DO YOU DO?

T-Rex: Honestly, it's kinda a dating simulator with sidequests, and if you're ever in a relationship the only advice you can get is "let's make a thing and then ask for it'!!
Utahraptor: Does it work?
T-Rex: Let's find out!

T-Rex: The thing is, God, it doesn'T even tell you when it might be helpful. What does it tell you when God wants you to sleep with him whenever? What does it tell you when God wants you to write him emails that say "HEY GUYS LOOK WHAT HE ACTUALLY GOT ON THREAD. MAYBE. I GOT TO TALK TO HIM. HEULAR."
God: SURE I COULD SEE THAT
T-Rex: Really?
God: THAT'S THE THIRD TIME IN A RUSHDAY I HAVE EVER EATED WITH YOU
