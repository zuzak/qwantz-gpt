T-Rex: I finally figured out what a timer works by looking at what's been going on in my life over the past 24 hours!

T-Rex: Here's how it works: you're in a stupor, and your #1 priority is now - being well!
T-Rex: Now, THAT'S awesome, but it's not super practical. We could be doing tons of stuff that's not really worth doing, and then at least that'll give us time to think about it.
T-Rex: Oh. Okay, so #2 is being sad!

T-Rex: Now, that's KINDA awesome! But sadness IS a THING that's worth doing, and I need to start doing it, right? Maybe starting a family...
Utahraptor: ... family?

T-Rex: Oh man...um ever wonder why my friends are always making jokes about me??
