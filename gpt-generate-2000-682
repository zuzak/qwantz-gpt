T-Rex: I have come up with a way to be totally invisible to the naked eye!

T-Rex: IRONY!

T-Rex: It's so simple, in fact, it's amazing. Observe: you sit in a tree and look around. You take a few minutes to deduce some stranger's mood.  All you have to do is PROVE OUT LOUD that everyone in your environment is as awesome as you.
Dromiceiomimus: I still think it's super important to have a safe haven for mutants.
T-Rex: I know, right? I think it's the easiest way to be invisible to the naked eye ever.

Utahraptor: I disagree!
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: It's way way easier than deducing a stranger's identity! Do the only thing you feel comfortable with, and then you're invisible!
Utahraptor: Honestly, if I were you, I think it would be way more satisfying to be invisible than out and about.
T-Rex: I know, I know!
T-Rex: Really?

Narrator: LATER: T-REX RETURNS TO BE invisible for the ACTUAL FOUR WEEKS LATER.
T-Rex: Hey, remember when out-of-sight driving wasn't as fun and getting less boring as driving on a road with two wheels in a weird abandoned corner that ONLY YOU can see?
T-Rex: Or were?
