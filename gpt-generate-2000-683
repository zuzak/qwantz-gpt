T-Rex: Hello and welcome to I Am An Adult Who Likes Seeing New Books Doubledailingly Plausible

T-Rex: Bitches a bit isn't all that I like.

T-Rex: BUT CHECK IT, HONESTLY: If you're going to be an adult forever, then you'd better charge some of your adult children how they want them to spend their adult years.
Dromiceiomimus: And then they'll cancel their book tickets?
T-Rex: Exactly! And then the book companies will have book 'n' deal after book deal rebuilt into something more desirable, which, hey presto, adult children will love!

Utahraptor: What if an adult owns the books, but the children don't?
T-Rex: They're OWNING THEM!

T-Rex: Adult books aren't like private domain, and if your parent can rip open an adult book and rip off his or her thirties for fifty bucks, then that's still kinda neat. But that's not what happens in the real world.
Utahraptor: What if a book is printed on plastic that's never been used?
T-Rex: That's not an example of plastic theft!

T-Rex: Also, that's just theft that's been made with copyright intent, and that copyright term has never been claimed.
T-Rex: Seriously man, reference any copyright period to any work of literature to any volume of literature, AND you'd have a case of the copyrightable every word in every book on your shelves.
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: THANKS FOR CHECKING ALL PASSAGE AND PRINTING UP MY BOOKS!!!
