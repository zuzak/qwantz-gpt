T-Rex: Dudes!  Whom do I not name?

T-Rex: Although, here I will give my honest opinion!

T-Rex: It is a fact that most people choose to name their children after what they did or did not do in life.  That is called "name calling"!
Dromiceiomimus: But what if you didn't do anything but do the boring stuff?  That is called "Not being an excellent soccer player"?
T-Rex: That is called "Not being an excellent cook"?

Utahraptor: But what if you were married?
T-Rex: Um.  That is not a very good name?

Utahraptor: Well, that's one thing I don't want to name babies.  They're KIDS.  They don't gossip all over babies.
T-Rex: Exactly!  I will call them "Baby Oops!"

Narrator: LATER:
Baby Oops!
T-Rex: Hello!  You'll love my baby!
Baby Oops!
Baby Oops!
Baby Oops!
