T-Rex: Last year was a good year. This year, I'm going to be better. I'm going to make MISTAKE after MISSELLING the trends that have been developing for the past year!

T-Rex: I will be better than last year.

Narrator: MISTAKE COMICS:

T-Rex: First, a picture of me and Samantha, with my BABY. That's me on a hot summer's day. Then, I rub shoulders with my friends and make new girlfriends!
T-Rex: ...That image is actually a pretty convincing excuse for not having a child.
T-Rex: Finally, I stare at the ceiling and feel a chill run down the end of my back.

Utahraptor: That's the BEST image you've ever created?
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yeah. And it's never going to come out. I'm not even certain if it's the best. Maybe the best we can do is have a picture of you with a pregnant woman, sitting in a parked car next to a cartoonishly sexy cat.
T-Rex: Holy crap. You've just made my night become a NIGHTMARE MYDITION??

Narrator: WARNING: THE ULTIMATE MESSAGE:
T-Rex: Never go to sleep AGAIN!
T-Rex: Night life sucks and you should go sleep more.
