T-Rex: One day, a bunch of us were sitting around, and we were thinking, "why not have some fun wacky times until we all got old?"

T-Rex: So we thought maybe we should get some fun wacky times until we all got to be boring!

T-Rex: But then we thought, well, we could do something fun for less money, so we'd waste our money on making them more fun!
Dromiceiomimus: Fun equals lessness, therefore it was time to have some fun times.
T-Rex: Difficulty equals lessness, therefore it was time to have some fun times AND to spend our money on making them MORE FUN.

Utahraptor: So decide yourself!
T-Rex: Yes!

T-Rex: But rather than thinking about it from my vantage point of convenience, let me go back in time to the time I invented the first computer!
Utahraptor: So you thought the time you invented the first computer was about 3 days ago?
T-Rex: Yes, that's correct

Narrator: BACK IN TIME:
T-Rex: So I decide to play some games of peek-a-boo!
T-Rex: And one of my best friends suggests I play some games of peek-a-boo!
