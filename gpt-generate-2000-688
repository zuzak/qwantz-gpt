T-Rex:  Infinite Motorcycles is a great name if you want a bike with an insane 99.999% chance of failing.  But doesn't the 100% mean that 99.999% of bikes fail?  No, because that would mean that 99.999% of bikes fail, one by one!

T-Rex:  So what does 100% mean?

T-Rex:  Well, it turns out the answer to that question is "Yes!"  Crazy bikes are something crazy aplenty, but aren't they?  And in any case:  100% yes.
T-Rex:  I say we make bikes more common, and make them count!
