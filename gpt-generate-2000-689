T-Rex: I have a friend who decided that, for the love of God, he'd better get on with his life.  And that, my friend, is to be filled with the curse of not having a job!

T-Rex: A job?

T-Rex: A job that pays me 12 dollars an hour and that I'm not allowed to forget!
Dromiceiomimus: A job that pays you 12 dollars an hour?
T-Rex: A job that pays you 12 dollars an hour, Dromiceiomimus!!

Utahraptor: But those aren't the only benefits of being on welfare, my friend!
T-Rex: Sure are!

T-Rex: I am surrounded on all sides of the issue, and as such I will endeavour to make the best possible use of my 12 hour contract.
Utahraptor: That contract should be something to go to the movies, not to heaven.
T-Rex: Yes. Yes, I agree.

Narrator: SHORTLY:
T-Rex: Dude, come on! It's not like you can Movie to the Radio and not have the God damn right to forget my stupid 12 hour contract!
God: IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN GIVE UP YOUR RIGHTS
T-Rex: Dude!!
T-Rex: MAN
T-Rex: I've said my goodbyes
