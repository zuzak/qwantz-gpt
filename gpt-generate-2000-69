T-Rex: In today's society, knowing someone's interests can be a powerful tool!

T-Rex: It can make a real person feel at home!

T-Rex: But this is dangerous, because knowing someone's interests can also be making them feel weird or un-American!  "Why am I worried about being straight??" you might ask.  Well, it turns out it's because we have different cultural assumptions than people!
Dromiceiomimus: We do, T-Rex!  Different cultural assumptions allow us to empathize with and care for people who are different.
T-Rex: Exactly!  We're different species!

Utahraptor: But then what happens if you misunderstand?
T-Rex: Sometimes there's danger in reporting an interest!

T-Rex: If you put in the effort, it'll happen.  But if you don't, it'll just happen anyway.
Utahraptor: And that's okay!  Everyone has different opinions!
T-Rex: We do!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Hey buddy, what's the latest on my relationship with my crush?
Bubba: I'm not even sure what's going on here
T-Rex: I'm pretty sure it's platonic love!
