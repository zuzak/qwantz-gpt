T-Rex: To a man, the future is a beautiful place. To a woman, it's a nightmare. To each his own, crushingly terrible reality. All we've got to do is wait and see.

T-Rex: But then we can start planning for our own future too!

T-Rex: So now we have a fully-diverse future, but where are all the new characters? Where's the old character that was alien from the guy we replaced?
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe in our fifties! Or perhaps not so much in the last century, where writing rules were changed and getting jobs was really hard.
T-Rex: Perhaps. But I can imagine a world where we have at least some idea of what the future will be like, and where we can expect work?
Dromiceiomimus: Assuming everyone is still around!

Utahraptor: Or maybe in technology at this point, it's still utopia!
T-Rex: Precisely!!

T-Rex: Maybe in technology, we've forgotten about past typos and misspellings and - surprise! - a brilliant scientist accidentally gave us all a fanciful understanding of how time travel works.
Utahraptor: Indeed!
T-Rex: Wait - maybe the future will have at it!!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Professor, I am Dr. Frankenstein's Frankenstein, and I can create anything I want!
Dr. Frankenstein: Check it!
T-Rex: I will give you my monster...
