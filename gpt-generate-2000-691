T-Rex: I just had the funniest thought! Every time I think about it, someone else thinks of it too!

T-Rex: It's funny because it's always there, because we all have thoughts, and it's always the same: how tragic it would be to let someone down, but you know it by a few points.  For instance, I don't think it's a bad idea to let down someone, but I can see myself stomping over others if that were the case.

T-Rex: Similarly, when I think about it again and again, I wish I'd marry the one who got shot, but if it were up to me, I wouldn't be doing that.
Utahraptor: I find that unlikely.
T-Rex: I know!

T-Rex: I find that depressing.  I don't really know how to help people, and even if I had, it's not much help at all!
T-Rex: I guess I'd have to live with that.
Utahraptor: That's not the worst part.

T-Rex: I guess I'd have to live with that for a while.  I guess I'd have to live with that for a while.
T-Rex: *sigh*
