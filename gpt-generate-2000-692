T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate way to be totally invisible! I have come up with the ultimate way to be totally invisible! 

T-Rex: Everyone will think you're invisible for all of eternity!

T-Rex: But if you're discovered to be invisible, then EVERYONE will be forced to apologize to me in some spooky way or else. It's like the Judeo-Christian Mystery, except all you're doing is admitting to being invisible forsoas. "Dear spooky guy: I'm invisible!" Everyone will say they wish they were invisible.
Dromiceiomimus: Ah, I get it. Uncanny!
T-Rex: I know!

Utahraptor: Everyone will say, "Ah, yes. I was slightly invisible until now!"
T-Rex: Everyone will say, "Ah, yes. I must be really awesome to everyone."

Utahraptor: But then everyone will off-panel say, "Ah, but how so? Suddenly, all my life I have been invisible and am now suddenly super awesome."
T-Rex: Then they'll do!
Utahraptor: Then they wont even say that!

Utahraptor: It will be awesome to laugh at their hilarious joke, but then everyone will think, "How so super? Suddenly, my chuckle will be punctuated only by a retort; then I am out."
T-Rex: "How so?"
T-Rex: "As I am the only one ever to have been invisible forsoas."
