T-Rex:  Hello, friend!  I'm T-Rex and this is my very first comic.  I'm not even going to be a genius anymore.  I should've been a dr.  a doctor, and that would've helped me out!  But instead I'm a total dud!

T-Rex:  I'm a total dumpy!

Dromiceiomimus:  Do you think you could become a master?
T-Rex:  Nope!  I can just teach myself to stand still and talk as I read this, Dromiceiomimus.
T-Rex:  But I won't actually be a doctor for long.  I'll just read more comics, and I won't even know if I'm a genius until I figure out how to program my head properly.  And then, I'll be back to school feeling even worse because I totally was never a genius!

Utahraptor:  But don't you think you could PROFIT yourself from reading comics?
T-Rex:  Of course not!

T-Rex:  I just can't.  I'm too ashamed.  I look down on people who have the gift they look up in their parents' library, open the book and see the words: "In my heart of hearts, I will always be a dr."
Utahraptor:  T-Rex, you are the ultimate dude!  You don't even need a phone to listen to me!

T-Rex:  You can get comics and then start reading!  Then you can improve yourself up, so you no longer look at comic books to impress your friends!  You can step away from the house and admire the works of others.  It's the power of comics!
T-Rex:  I AM TOTALLY A DUDES.
