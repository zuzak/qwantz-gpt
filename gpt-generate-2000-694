Narrator: T-REX AND HIS DINOSAUR FRIENDS IN: "THE TALKING DINOSAUR"
T-Rex: Everybody! If you want to talk about my friendship with you, then you should stop!

T-Rex: That's not very helpful, Dromiceiomimus! You're always on the go and nobody wants to talk to me about friendship is all!
Dromiceiomimus: Well then, I guess I'm going to have to find a more permanent home.
T-Rex: Perhaps! But I've decided to continue this conversation by telling you how I once again decided to change my friends' minds!

T-Rex: This is due to the course of my life changing...!
Utahraptor: "I"?

T-Rex: "This"? "This"? Suddenly Utahraptor was right in the middle of all this talk!
Utahraptor: It was just a regular friend who was nice to flip through a book.
T-Rex: Good God! You're getting old.
Utahraptor: I guess I'll get about 2000 of my own, go to a party, and RESCUATIERS you some beer!

T-Rex: And before you ask...
T-Rex: ... I now wish I'd switched back to reality and left you alone with a beer.
T-Rex: DUDE
T-Rex: I'm leaving my name to the people around me
