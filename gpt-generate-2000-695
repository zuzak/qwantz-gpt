T-Rex:  Hello and welcome to  Jeopardy, a reality competition you may have missed out on!!

T-Rex:  So give us a minute!
T-Rex:  So BASICALLY every decision I make affects mine, and every decision I make affects mine for the next million years.

T-Rex: Therefore, my decision making is based on innately based probabilities!  And that means my choices have a huge effect on mine, the PROBLEM is, DEFINITELY on these 80s Jeopardy reality competition reality competitions would have been good at!
Dromiceiomimus:  Oh my gosh Icing on my words disappoint me Dromiceiomimus!!

T-Rex:  And that's why I got so mad!  I thought my choices were based on not even factoring in lottery ticket sales, so I'D be mad at Jeopardy.
Utahraptor:  Oh no!

T-Rex:  And that's why I got so angry.  It seemed like a really attractive way to solve all my problems.
Utahraptor:  But we've still got over 60 years to fix all the problems!

Narrator:  BUT THOSE 60s JOKES DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WE'RE BUSY IF WE'RE GOING TO PICK HER UP
T-Rex:  Man, now I'm saying all you've done is play Magic the Gathering and miss out on a whole host of things that I can't get, like T-Rex's dream of owning a helicopter and flying it around the world, and then when I get home, fixing the game is so hard that it's like walking a dog.
