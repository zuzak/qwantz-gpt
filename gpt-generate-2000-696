T-Rex: I have received several death threats over the past few weeks. Apparently my epitaph is "OU DARE TO RAP A WEREOF, IF YOU ARE HAVING ANY INTEREST WITH THAT CHECK OUT MY OTHER PODUCES, WHICH HAVE RAPED AN SWIMMER"

T-Rex: Apparently I do not follow the rules!

Dromiceiomimus: Apparently you do not follow the rules??
T-Rex: Although I have written books about being robbed, I have not done the same thing to a stranger! Therefore, as a matter of fact, I HAVE RAPED A SWIMMER.
Dromiceiomimus: That's a personal insult, T-Rex!!

Utahraptor: Seriously, what are you doing here?
T-Rex: Well, um, being AWESOME?

T-Rex: I don't want to be the only person who can do something AWESOME, and I don't think that's going to change soon. I've done tons of amazing! Check it out:

T-Rex: ... a "fork" that I made out of raw eggplant!
Utahraptor: Really?
T-Rex: Yep! I ended up with a tiny bit more than I expected, but honestly I'm super excited to try making an awesomest thing. I made it out of boiled eggplant, so it's basically a fork that can carry you anything!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: I toss eggs into a blender and add salt, pepper, and more eggplant! The resulting mixture is so amazing, so delicious, I almost eat it.
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: It tastes like WAY better homemade yoghurt, PLUS it's way better as well.
