T-Rex: Britannic was Titanic's sister ship!  After Titanic sank, she replaced the broken propeller with a new, more powerful underwater propeller.

T-Rex: This gave Titanic more room to move around and could have saved lives!

T-Rex: But as she was no longer in her original role, she was put in peril, as she would later say: "Like the boat that saved the life of a man: Never be saved from the jaws of Hell."
T-Rex: lives:??

Utahraptor: So she's a sub in this story?
T-Rex: Yes!  She's called "The Titanic" because she's the only ship in the story that was in the Titanic "torch" as it sank!  That's the name given to the ship that was the Titanic propeller failure.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: THE TATTOO PARTS?  I thought they were called "The Thetattoo Part" and "The Totally Stupid Star Trek Movie"!
T-Rex: They're called "The Totally Stupid Star Trek" because they're so STRANGER than the movies they're associated with!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I really don't understand how you're going to believe a story about a fictional character, when you could've written about my ridiculous premise??
