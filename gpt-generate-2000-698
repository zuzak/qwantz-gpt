T-Rex: So it turns out that you can't escape from a relationship if you're gay and you're bi.

T-Rex: You HAVE to start it up again!

T-Rex: And that's easy! Simply take off your clothes, and while you're at the office, try to make eye contact. If he's Asian, he'll say "oh my god, your hands are so small" or "oh my gosh I can't believe you" at this point the whole time the phone is ringing. Don't lie, guys!
Dromiceiomimus: There's probably some place you can go if you want to go straight to the bathroom.
T-Rex: But why should I care if I can lie to him about my skin colour?

Utahraptor: It's just, like, a Coke can?
T-Rex: It's just a Coke can?

T-Rex: A regular regular regular Coke, yeah. Can't help it?
Utahraptor: Can't -- you can't?
T-Rex: Okay, sure! Okay, try harder next time.
T-Rex: And THAT'S it?

Narrator: SOON!
T-Rex: Okay, great -- I'm going to go lie down and wait for the tv to change to "dogs now dogs are sexy" and I'm single!
T-Rex: But that won't work! I'll TRAVEL THE WORLD, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: I'm single?
T-Rex: Why?
T-Rex: WHY NOT?!
