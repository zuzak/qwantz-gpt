T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate way to be happy. It's simple. Simply take everything you know about yourself AND your friends and multiply it by that!

T-Rex: You'll multiply everything you know about yourself by ADORABLE ANTLERS.

T-Rex: Okay so say you've had a relationship that's been going on for a while, and you think things could be better, and you maybe think things could be brought to a close, and now you're happy. Maybe you really think things could be done better, and now you're sad. Or you think things could be done better, and you honestly don't know! MAYBE this has something to do with how you feel right now?

Utahraptor: Well, at least this is how you know things could be done better, my friend!
T-Rex: True!

T-Rex: But you're not changing your personality! Observe: I'm not changing ANYONE. Change only OBVIOUSLY.
Utahraptor: I can see why that would make me feel better.
T-Rex: Change only OBVIOUSLY.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hey, think of how happy I would be if things were ever best for the "greatest successes" scenario, actually have SOME effect on it!!
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: Pretty sure that'd be awesome
