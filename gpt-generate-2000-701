T-Rex: Today is the day I write "Hello, world!". I have no plans tomorrow. Today is the day I do ANTARCTICA.

Narrator: T-REX IN: "AN ATOMIC RESPONSE TO ANSWERS"

T-Rex: The ANTARCTICA I know comes from the fact that I've been experimenting with an amazing chemical!
Utahraptor: An ant's reaction to an ANTARCTICA is different than that of a human!

T-Rex: I'm SO EXCITED. I totally know how amazing the reaction is. I totally look forward to experimenting with this stuff!!
Utahraptor: Plus, the reaction is reversible, which gives us something to talk about! Plus, it's a great excuse for us to take breaks from work while we research new science!

T-Rex: And yes, I do plan to take a break from work while I write this.
T-Rex: I HAVE BECOME SEVERAL DECLINE TO PUT MY MIND TO THINGS HAPPENING
