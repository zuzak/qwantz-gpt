T-Rex: I'm not a guy who is afraid to say "Hey!" when I feel down. Or, for that matter, when I'm ACTUALLY talking to someone else.

T-Rex: It's the power of wordplay!

T-Rex: I can play it by accident, and suddenly it's SO MUCH more interesting than regular words alone are! For example, Dromiceiomimus, you're a danger to yourself and everyone you know! Now I'm not playing it by accident. I'm not afraid of being called a danger to himself!
Dromiceiomimus: Um
T-Rex: That's fine! Just fine!

T-Rex: Just because you're out in the open doesn't mean, I think, that you're not a danger to others?
Utahraptor: T-Rex, are you... afraid of words?
T-Rex: Depends on what you mean!

T-Rex: "I'm not afraid of words" is fine if it means "I'm not going to be silly", but if it's actually "I'm not afraid of being silly right now", I don't think you're one of those guys.
Utahraptor: Well, I guess it depends on the situation.
T-Rex: Alright then, I'm going to be silly.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: "But I'm not afraid of being silly"
