T-Rex: I've always been reluctant to get a tattoo.  I don't want to be Captain Suggestible, and the whole "Sassana wouldaaccompaniment" thing wouldn't pull me in K-ON.  But I've come up with a solution.  Tattoos that only cost a dollar a photo, and that have already inspired thousands of people with their own captions on the side, and that are only slightly less fetching!

T-Rex: For example: "Sassana wouldaaccompaniment: we're going to bed."

T-Rex: "We're going to bed: Captain Suggestibility!"
Dromiceiomimus: Those don't seem that amazing.
T-Rex: INTERESTING.  How is this a solution?
Dromiceiomimus: They don't seem to actually be profitable for the artist either.  If they had, I would rephrase the lyrics to "Baby we descramble thin we'refloated we'rea gotta breath deeply; and baby we descramble the lungs; and baby we exhale."

Utahraptor: But -
T-Rex: But I could just use that!

T-Rex: "Baby we descramble the lungs, into the ground; baby we descramble the liver, and baby we exhale."
Utahraptor: ...
T-Rex: Baby we descramble the liver, into the ground we'rea gonna use that to our full advantage.

T-Rex: "Baby we descramble the bbqootie, where the whale can lance himself. Baby we descramble the bbqootie, where the bald eagle can gallop himself. Baby we descramble the bbqootie, where the zeppelin can lance itself. Baby we descramble the bbqootie, where the warp armon IS the bald eagle. Baby we descramble the bbqootie WHERE'S THE ZOOMBER."
T-Rex: Utahraptor I hate that it seems like I'm the target of my own Mr. Tusks.
