T-Rex: Another day, another bizarre twist in the weather.  This time, the storm is just as heavy, and it's been a bright -isow... - day.

T-Rex: It's been a very unusual -isow... - day.

T-Rex: Nobody has been hurt, and the extent of damage is only believed to be several meters (generously reported, I rule) wide.
Dromiceiomimus: Dang, that guy is dangerous.
T-Rex: He rules by fear! He rules by fear!

Utahraptor: I think it's worth a try, my friend!
T-Rex: You're right!

T-Rex: I have considered several alternatives, all of them indistinguishable from the one I was using as the initial reference. All of them I consider likely to be viable: snow, ice, and/or giant rocks.
Utahraptor: Wow, that's some hope for the dangerous future, T-Rex!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I'm back, Utahraptor! And I say this without exaggeration: this is, in fact, the worst snowfall ever.
Utahraptor: Oh, is that a compliment?
T-Rex: It was... oh- It was SO GOOD.
