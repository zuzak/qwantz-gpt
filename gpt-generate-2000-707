Narrator: HOW TO PASS FOR A HUMAN BEING
T-Rex: Human beings are complicated, but they're also not really that complicated. We're just like them!

T-Rex: We're made of living tissue, some of which can hold several species of animal, and this tissue is fused to our bodies by special, man-made means.
T-Rex: We're not... made of... living flesh??

Utahraptor: Maybe some of this amazing raw material can be donated?
T-Rex: YES. Donate some to us in need, Utahraptor! Our standards are the highest in the world.
T-Rex: WHOOPS

T-Rex: Just one warning, though: don't eat our food. Fish won't hunt us. Our skin will encase our faces in it. And when we eat it, fish will scratch our backs for cover??
T-Rex: ...Ohhhh

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Apparently if we eat too much our body will catastrophically collapse into a new state of near-zero entropy, and we'll all be dead for good.
T-Rex: *cough*
T-Rex: *hiccup*
