God: T-REX I FORGOT TO HAVE A SERM AND NOT A KISS
T-Rex: Am I finally ready to settle down and deal with this normally? Maybe there will be some time for that now?

T-Rex: Maybe I just haven't had the energy or motivation to motivate myself since last night?

T-Rex: Maybe tonight I've been going out of my way to make sure that tonight doesn't get any better. Maybe tonight I've been totally clear on one thing:
Dromiceiomimus: tonight?
T-Rex: Tonight.
T-Rex: I'm ready.

Utahraptor: Tonight?
T-Rex: I'm going to try to make tonight as good as possible! And tonight I'm going to make it great as a KISSNAT, so all is good!

T-Rex: Tonight! God, come here!
God: PLEASE.
God: IT'S A NON-PROFESSIONAL THING
T-Rex: Um, hello?
God: UH
God: SEE
God: WHAT'S GOING ON
