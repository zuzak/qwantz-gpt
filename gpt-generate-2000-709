T-Rex: The saddest thing I can imagine is a kid who's very sick, but who still loves to play marbles in the park! He's got a mobile IV, and one day it gets stuck in a storm drain on a teal CEMETERY STATION, so lovely are the teal trees of olden times.  And so it turns out it's a MISTAKE to have a teal battery installed in each floor of the tank, and turns out the only place that battery can normally be found is on the ground.

T-Rex: Only teal is actually a renewable resource, and since it's been around for thousands of years, we should have at least some idea of what's going on here!
T-Rex: except that's not in the water, which is WORST

T-Rex: And if there's one resource that's BROKEN, it's steel!
Utahraptor: Teal?

T-Rex: Seriously, however, you average it out and give us the sum of its parts.  This year, WE'LL be T-Rex or something.
Utahraptor: I guess we'll just have to settle for a less-than-stellar 1.029?
T-Rex: Oh man, I guess we'll just have to live with that.

T-Rex: Let's see what's new in ten years, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: I guess we'll just have to live with that.
T-Rex: Well, at least we'll live in a more cost-efficient world.  So that means less teal in the long run.
T-Rex: Alright, so go ahead and say "I guess we'll just have to live with that."
T-Rex: That's still pretty much where we are right now, Utahraptor
