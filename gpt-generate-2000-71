T-Rex: I'm really looking forward to what's to come for breakfast, breakfast!!

T-Rex: Oh! Okay, so everyone who made me hot sauce!

T-Rex: And an egg!

T-Rex: An old maid who said she's sick and needs a bath. Then she throws some dirty clothes into the well and STEAL THEM, cleaning them constantly. Nobody comes and they eat them. Then she gets really gross and wants to die. I, the T-Rex, am going to solve her problems with my solution: I'm going to cook her some bread.

Utahraptor: It's such a hot meal, T-Rex! It's SO hot!
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: It tastes like it's made of my own excrement, and people are forced to wake up for it every day! I'm going to cook the meal in a restaurant and bring the corpses home, so that when people come to clean the places, they don't smell like they're being suffocated by worms or poops.
Utahraptor: I'm not sure that's... ethical?

T-Rex: It's so ethical that way, right? I'm literally going to cook a lot of bread, and then some I'll wash my hands in the wash, and then some I'll rub my dry hair into the hair. It'll be SO YET, both a romantic evening of LANGUAGE AND CRAZY EMOTION.
T-Rex: I'm hoping by talking about it I'll get lots of new things to do in my time!
