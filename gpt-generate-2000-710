T-Rex: I have the best idea for a story. It's a WWII drama!

T-Rex: I'll start with a girl -
T-Rex: She's 7 then?

T-Rex: -she's got a GIANT BODY.
T-Rex: And we're walking down the street and there, behind us, is a little girl. 
T-Rex: Oh my god, are you guys"...magnetic?"
T-Rex: Are you guys actually, like, poltergeists?

Utahraptor: I don't know - are we being MAGIC?
T-Rex: Um, - are we being MAGIC?

T-Rex: "I don't know, but it sure is awesome to be invisible."
Utahraptor: "Being invisible is the invisible slip of the tongue."
T-Rex: "Being invisible is when you're invisible to everyone, and the only people you know are invisible to you."

T-Rex: "Being invisible is when you're invisible to everyone only if you lie about it to everyone else too."
T-Rex: "Being invisible is when you lie to your friend only if he or she is pretty sure."
