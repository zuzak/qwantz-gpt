T-Rex: I suspect that I have overstepped my mark in plagiarism.

T-Rex: I believe that I have plagiarized quite a bit!

T-Rex: For example, Dromiceiomimus, I wrote "Baby, how sweet a party I'll be having with friends on Hallowe'en... !"
Dromiceiomimus: ha ha ha good one!
T-Rex: Thanks!!

Utahraptor: Are you actually dropping the ball here, or am I simply a bit incredulous?
T-Rex: Well!

T-Rex: I'm simply a bit excited to be able to throw my own "party" idea into motion.  The perfect solution to a specific social problem!
Utahraptor: Okay!
T-Rex: Well, thanks for the invitation, my friend!

Narrator: YEARS LATER, THE TALK:
T-Rex: Oh my gosh! I need to go make a "party" that appeals to both women and men (who, I should add, are WAY too fussy) and also includes plenty of photos of me giving talks!
T-Rex: Also, I need to get down to zero tolerance and get this party going now.
