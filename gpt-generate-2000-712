T-Rex: I've decided that I will play by my own rules.  Rules that don't require ANY specific knowledge of the rules of the road!

T-Rex: Just move left onto the left!

T-Rex: Okay, so the rules are that you move up a few spaces when you leave the room.  You must move a little bit higher to make it appear like you're moving past the door.  It doesn't count.
Dromiceiomimus: On the other hand, you're moving down a few spaces when you enter a closed-circuit "open" system.
T-Rex: See? See? Rules like no new door, no new spin, just a return to the regular "norm".

Utahraptor: What's new is that the "norm" is a series of actions that move you throughout the day!
T-Rex: Yes!

T-Rex: So instead of saying "I'm here to solve problems; this is merely the tip of the iceberg", you can say, "Man, this incredibly helpful new technology has made me a more-enquiry-oriented friend, which in turn has increased my value-added potential."
Utahraptor: I call shenanigans of this sort.
T-Rex: No.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hey, Utahraptor!
T-Rex: INTERESTING.
T-Rex: Can you solve my problems WITH my solution?
