T-Rex: I have the best idea for a Batman comic. It's a Batman comic about a guy whose whole life has been going in a Batman comic.

T-Rex: It won't be about Batman.

T-Rex: Instead, it's about squirrels.
Dromiceiomimus: Are squirrels actually a mammal?
T-Rex: A mammal! I know this as being one of the most important principles of my philosophy, Dromiceiomimus.

T-Rex: But why should I explain the FACTS of my philosophy in a story about a squirrel?
Utahraptor: A squirrel!

T-Rex: Because if you don't, the reader will understand why this case is important.
Utahraptor: A squirrel?
T-Rex: Yes. The reader will understand why this case is so important.

T-Rex: It's like - a Batman comic?
T-Rex: No, a Batman comic about a guy whose whole life has been going in a Batman comic.
T-Rex: It'll be about squirrels.
Utahraptor: A squirrel!
T-Rex: No, a squirrel.
T-Rex: NO, a Batman comic about a guy whose entire life has been going in a Batman comic.

T-Rex: Oh yeah? A squirrel with a sprinkler in the corner?
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: I know, right?
