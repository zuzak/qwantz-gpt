T-Rex: I have been thinking, and I have come up with the perfect solution to the problem of my being perceived as "cool" by those perceived as being "cooler", as in, "cooler than I am"!

T-Rex: I will never be perceived as cool by people who aren't in my employ!

T-Rex: I will always be seen as exceptional, even through the triviality of my own personal successes.
T-Rex: I will never be reduced to second-guessing someone's thoughts or analysis.

T-Rex: I will never be forced to pay for gifts I receive through social media.
Utahraptor: These can only be accomplished through legal means!

T-Rex: My entire personality as imagined by T-Rex can only be objectively evaluated at the societal level, and can result in my being reduced to mere opinions and stereotypes.
Utahraptor: Truly the end!
T-Rex: As a consequence of my own actions, I will no longer be an "expert" in any meaningful way.

T-Rex: I will be reduced to quietly challenging authority, and will no longer have any agency in the first place.
T-Rex: The end!
