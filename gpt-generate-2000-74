T-Rex: T-Rex is a guy who says "I'll get Dick Tracy", and then when he hears that he starts to feel physically sick.  He goes to the hospital and weot because he's sick.

T-Rex: It's not that bad, physically!

T-Rex: I'm just worried about the next few days, because I've been going through my hospital record check and he's listed as stable, but he's listed as a patient with a history of CHILD INSURANCE.  This makes it very interesting for the next few weeks!
Dromiceiomimus: What about the next few weeks?
T-Rex: The next few weeks, you go out and have some hang-outs!  And MAYBE, you take some pictures with me while you're there!

Utahraptor: There are probably other STUFF that you'd rather not discuss, T-Rex!
T-Rex: No, but -

T-Rex: There are probably other STUFF that I can and will keep hidden from you.
Utahraptor: I would imagine!
T-Rex: PERHAPS!

T-Rex: Hey!  You know all about that stuff, huh?
T-Rex: You know all about that stuff, right?
