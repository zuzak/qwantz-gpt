T-Rex: I think I have sex addiction, but like, for food!

T-Rex: It's weird!

T-Rex: When I come around later on, I'm like, man, this isn't supposed to be my problem.  Why is it that everyone seems to have an insatiable appetite for food when I actually DO have an insatiable appetite for sex?
T-Rex: It's the food thing.
T-Rex: It gets worse!

Utahraptor: Maybe it's your sexual addiction, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's a big deal.

T-Rex: It's like you're obsessed with looking in a mirror, but then you realize just how blind you are to the side effect! It's this inexorable and constant realization that you're not in any mirror!
Utahraptor: I don't know, I got that feeling myself.
T-Rex: I know!
T-Rex: But it's so intense, you know?

T-Rex: It keeps on happening just before my eyes close, and it's like - it's this endless, constant feeling that I'm not in any mirror!
T-Rex: It's so freeing, I - 
T-Rex: "Close your eyes, I'm trapped in this infinite, constantly-refreshing state of unreality"
