T-Rex: One day a lady named Pasiphae gave birth to a creature with the head of a bull and the body of a guy, which explained why everybody likes to pierce their bonds of friendship with baited shots and giant metal balls.

T-Rex: Except chickens, which got smaller and smaller as time went on?

T-Rex: And horses, which decided to stay in friendship with their better-known friends until they got old. Then they died of old age! THEN, they got old and died of boredom!
Dromiceiomimus: So you blame horses!
T-Rex: But maybe that's just your unique take on the story! Maybe the chickens are the best, funniest, best selling point!

Utahraptor: Maybe the REAL problem with the story is its central paradox!
T-Rex: A COMPELLING one, eh?

T-Rex: Friggin'parallels are so entrenched in popular culture as to be almost palpable. Wouldn't it be great if every time you said something funny, someone would say, "Oh, I suppose you were just fooling yourself."?
Utahraptor: Exactly!
T-Rex: And that's exactly what it would sound like!

T-Rex: Every time you said something funny, someone would say, "Oh, I suppose you were just FLIRTING!"
Utahraptor: That's exactly as funny as if you were saying it out loud.
T-Rex: AND YET, every time you're OUT LIVING you're LIVING YOUR OWN life.
T-Rex: Yaaaaaaay
