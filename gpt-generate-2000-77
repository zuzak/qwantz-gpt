T-Rex: Oh my gosh, I have the perfect dream.  All dream, huh??

T-Rex: It's all dreams, right?

T-Rex: The dreamer is a real person, in real life.  They have real-life counterparts in real life.  Sleepwalkers are dreamwalkers.  In dreams, all dreams are dreams, with an unreal dreamer in the real life.  You wake up in the dream, and in that dream, you're a real dreamer, and when you sit down to rest, you're a real sleepwalker.  In dreams, dreams is all dreams: wake up in a world where you're a dreamer, then you're a dreamer and you get to sleepwalk for a few hours.

T-Rex: So, yeah dreams!
Utahraptor: I've got some problems with that too!

T-Rex: Well, let me fix them, okay?  Let me think of a dream that started...
Utahraptor: A few hours ago: a web page...let me know... OKAY.
T-Rex: Okay!  I'll fix it tomorrow.

Narrator: FIVE MONTHS LATER:
T-Rex: Hello everyone!  I woke up with a GIANT GIANT problem where my brain froze when I try to read a page.  It was almost like I was reading a story in my head, but then it got really interesting and weird.  I sort of threw up pages in my head, and then it was - really weird?  But I managed to read it and it was like, holy crap!  This is a HORRIBLE RIDDLE.  Why am I even bothering putting my hopes and dreams in this house?  I THINK I'M SO STUPID that I won't tell anyone until we all get to experience this, huh??

T-Rex: So!!  I'm lying, Dromiceiomimus!
Utahraptor: Yeah, it's a -

T-Rex: HORRIBLE RIDDLE.
Utahraptor: It's my idea, and it was RIGHT after I woke up.  I made a stupid breakfast I shouldn't have eaten, and then I woke up with a GIANT PROBLEM??
Utahraptor: YES.  We should all eat more breakfast.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary!  You should listen to this now because it's actually the best you'll ever read.  It's objectively the best you'll ever read when you read it, and in three words: GUESSED.
T-Rex: I GUESS I already am.
