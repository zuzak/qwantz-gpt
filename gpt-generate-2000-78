Narrator:  APOCALYPSE RULE CHANGES
T-Rex: Rule number one is, you can't have a single best ending.
T-Rex: Two best ends.

T-Rex:Threerd: Can't we all then have the same rule?
T-Rex: Rule two is, what if all the good, life, and potential suckers have turned against the existence of the King?
T-Rex: And THAT is me, the self-interested spectator!

Utahraptor: Rule three is, what if all the good, leading, and potentially valuable futures are at zero income?
T-Rex: Thanks, America!

Utahraptor: That's what rule five is.
T-Rex: But that's not very helpful!
T-Rex: I'm not sure we should give that power to a "good, living" nation.  We need more guidance.

T-Rex: I don't want to give the power to a zero-sum game, but -
T-Rex: I don't want to give it to one.
T-Rex: "No votes"?  Bad for the game!
