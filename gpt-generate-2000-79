T-Rex: I've been thinking, and I've come to the conclusion that

T-Rex: YES, yes I will be an excellent historian.

T-Rex: I will dedicate myself entirely to learning, and to developing, the skills and graces required to become one!
T-Rex: And then, no matter what I learn, it will be of value to me.

T-Rex: I will find in Alvin and his similarly situated lab or in the stories told about him, the skills and the circumstances required to share them with the world!
Utahraptor: One can expect little to no pay for such an ambitious and accomplished man!

T-Rex: Indeed!
T-Rex: However, as my friends were all raptors, I can safely say, "Yes, with confidence, I will be an excellent historian of the life of the party."
Utahraptor: Well, that leaves you, of course!
T-Rex: You're set!

T-Rex: You'll still have time to learn all that, if you keep up with all the other jobs I've got lined up!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: ...Oh!
T-Rex: *sigh*
