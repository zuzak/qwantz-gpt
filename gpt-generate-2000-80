T-Rex: Hello!  This means I have to sit down and write down some words I'd like to kiss someone tonight.  Will they love me?  Or will they hide it from me?

T-Rex: It's a good bet my words will be searchable, and the odds that someone will love me is pretty small.

Dromiceiomimus: But it's better than invisibly finding out you're not really alone in this giant pile of love in the first place!
T-Rex: Yes indeed!  It's what I ask of them!
Dromiceiomimus: Well then!  How should we start...

Utahraptor: So what's the kiss?
T-Rex: The exchange of feelings!

T-Rex: And if they love you still, that's still good!  That's what I'm going to say.  Remember...
Utahraptor: No!  Remember that no!
T-Rex: Remember that kiss?

T-Rex: Remember how when I kissed her I just wanted the emotionless sensation of her loving me, and then the cool thrill of knowing she liked me even though she didn't totally alone in a way!
T-Rex: (That's what I'm doing)
