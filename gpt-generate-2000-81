T-Rex:  Hello!           friend!
T-Rex:  I'm T-Rex and I'm here to say hello!

T-Rex:  It's good to be anonymous, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus:  How is this different from other friends, T-Rex?
T-Rex:  Well, you're saying that I'm not... anonymous?
Dromiceiomimus:  Yes.  And you're bettering yourself by sharing delicious, unexpected treats!
T-Rex:  Hello!    What's it like being anonymous?

T-Rex:  It's SUCH A rewarding job, eh?
Utahraptor:  You're not!  You're just setting up your anonymity by providing nice identifying information.

T-Rex:  ...Customers?
T-Rex:  ...Customers.   Customers are anonymous because they're anonymous and want the anonymity of strangers.
T-Rex:  ...Customers?

Utahraptor:  You also seem to have a history of sexual violence, T-Rex!
T-Rex:  ...No.  And I don't want that to happen to me.
T-Rex:  ...Three times?

Utahraptor:  Yes!
T-Rex:  ...And I don't want that to happen to me either.  Oh my gosh.
Utahraptor:  ...Three times?
T-Rex: ...Five times!
