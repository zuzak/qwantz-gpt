T-Rex: In the future, our brains are flooding with functional language that tells us we can do whatever we want with our lives. We are cyborgs, and here on Earth, our desires are platonic love.

T-Rex: T-REX THE BOD TOO!

T-Rex: But here on Earth, our minds are running wild with semantic corruption! We have no idea where our desires fit in with the rest of the computer age. If you wanted to say "I want sex with this cat", you'd have to do it in a colossally terrible way. That way, if the request gets through, it'll just pass right out. It's terrible!
T-Rex: Well, here's a solution: you'd just ask the cat to poop on you.

Utahraptor: Does this actually work?
T-Rex: If you ask the cat to poop on you, it won't poop on you, Utahraptor.

T-Rex: It's just - you're only doing this if there's a chance the request might get a decoy! And if you're sending a message to other living people, like a kid might sending a message to a stranger next door!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, that's not a very effective way to engage people.
T-Rex: Maybe it works best if you sent the message to someone on the street who doesn't know the difference!

T-Rex: ...That's not what "enthusiastic transmission" looks like.
