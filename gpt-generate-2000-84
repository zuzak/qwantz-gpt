T-Rex: FACT: there's a lot of bacteria floating around in oceans that could be treated with BLEACHES. And some of them are better than others!

T-Rex: Well! I've just made a miscalculation!!

T-Rex: But really, treating all the bacteria as a separate organism would be a great idea! We'd still be dealing with a single, stoic creature, and the rest would remain as kin. We'd be swimming, exploring, exploring, and, eventually, extinction!
Dromiceiomimus: So you think a more vibrant and interesting ocean provides more fertile land for life?
T-Rex: I - 

Utahraptor: I think you're assuming that the microbes that live in salty water can survive long in dense vegetation, and that's not the case!
T-Rex: Man! That's my joke.

T-Rex: The reason I'm throwing this joke around so well is this: I believe that as a person, I have the ability to be wrong. I believe that the more I hear about this joke the more confident I become, and I believe that if I'm to be believed, I'll be DEFINITELY right.
Utahraptor: And you believe you're a perfect and natural creature!

T-Rex: Yep! I believe this. And I'm SO OKAY. I'm gonna go do exactly what I's thinking! I'm going to BE ACHIEVE MATH!
Utahraptor: You're not allowed to be a man?
T-Rex: Man, that one's for SAD!
T-Rex: I'm SAD
