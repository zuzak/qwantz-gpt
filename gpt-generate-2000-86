T-Rex: Building a time machine is hard!

T-Rex: But maybe that's not the hardest thing??

T-Rex: We need a time machine that can restore broken computers to a simpler time!
T-Rex: That's a better idea than trying to restore broken time back to an unreliable third party!
T-Rex: That's not what we're going to do.  Time machines don't restore, and we don't have the means to restore broken computers back to an unreliable third party.

Utahraptor: So let's do it this way, T-Rex! We'll restore a broken time machine to an alternate time without taking away a single thing from it!
T-Rex: Sure!  We'll just take machines back from impossible times.
Utahraptor: We'll restore broken time machines to better machines, and let's just forget about time travel and cyborgisms for now.

T-Rex: FINE.  Everyone, start again!!
T-Rex: THANKS EVERYONE, and GOD!
T-Rex: at least we've somehow avoided this whole mess!
