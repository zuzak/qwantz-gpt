T-Rex: I had the strangest dream last night...

T-Rex: It was crazy!

T-Rex: People were always just looking for me!
T-Rex: It was like, the dream everyone has dreams meets reality, where everyone dreams is reality.
T-Rex: I don't remember much of the dream, but I do remember that it was crazy!

Utahraptor: It's the kind of dream that doesn't happen often, but when it does it's nice and I remember we had this dream last night!
T-Rex: It was nice!

T-Rex: But then Dromiceiomimus said we were done for each other!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, that's really weird!
T-Rex: I love how ridiculous your world view is!

T-Rex: I love how when people are gone, they still dream about how nice it is to be alone when they're gone!
T-Rex: I love how this dream ALSO included imagining how happy we would be if we had a computer.
T-Rex: We'd get emails all the time!
