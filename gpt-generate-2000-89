T-Rex: Everyone!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, pick a number between one and a hundred thousand million!
Dromoceiomimus: Seventeen?
T-Rex: Actually, I think I do! Do you think I could be as big as Santa?

[[Before adding in any new digits, T-Rex notes that rad we have a design challenge that I have to work through]]
Utahraptor: Hi! How's it going, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Listen, challenges are a part of the IDEA you've had before your face is implanted!

T-Rex: And yes, to that I should add...
T-Rex: ...BUGS."

T-Rex: "BUGS" is the Greek word for "bug" and is closely related to "claw" in English. Scientists have been able to enhance the noise and colour tones of their words with the help of a gene that ends in a TSHOMEC in Greek - making them Bugsy! Greeks love Bugsy because... Bugsy!
Dromiceiomimus: That's a reference to Bugsy who was a Greek Bug who Bugsy! T-Rex: WHAT

T-Rex: Actually, Bugsy was a Greek Bug who Bugsy. Scientists eventually derived the gene that actually DOES work in humans so now all words implanted with new gene's are Bugsy and then all new Bugsy eggs are Bugsy Eggs. It's a big leap for a human to think about, but they do it anyway.

T-Rex: Also, scientists implanted tiny gene's that made Bugsy's blood blood red in the morning.
Utahraptor: Wow

Utahraptor: That's pretty convincing. The gene actually DID work in humans though so now humans who have the gene can have all their feelings, which is a shame because humans would probably be way more into germmages than we are into Bugsy eggs.

T-Rex: Utahraptor, when you say that scientists can actually work in labs and implant gene's that make Bugsy eggs now, scientists must be doing some pretty awesome stuff.
T-Rex: I know right?
T-Rex: It makes me really glad I didn't get implanted with the gene that made Bugsy eggs.
