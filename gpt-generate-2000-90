T-Rex: I am writing a romance novel! Sweet!

T-Rex: I'm executive producing!

T-Rex: The story revolves around two young men (Jennifer Stewart and Jennifer Klug) who, out of all the people working for billionaire lawyer Michael Ch Grover, fall in love with a red-blooded woman (Jennifer Klug). Then, they fall in love again... with a Utahraptor (Jennifer Klug and Michael Ch Grover's wife). Then, they murder her!
Dromiceiomimus: Oh! Then they commit suicide.
T-Rex: Aww!!

Utahraptor: It's a pretty standard suicide story, isn't it?
T-Rex: Nope!

T-Rex: The characters are selfless and lovemaking but also have a hint of comedy in the splash of the title. There's certainly a laugh in every story.
Utahraptor: I can see that!
T-Rex: I know!
T-Rex: I love the idea of a prodigy writing a loveable loveable book of his own, without the need for a partner.

God: T-REX THIS IS A VERY EASY WAY TO IMAGINE CHIP
T-Rex: Chip is now clearly the best thing ever!!
God: AND ALSO the Chip that Cooks America Made!
God: WAIT A MINUTE IS AMAZINGLY PURE
T-Rex: Holy!

God: I Used to Pretend That Being Amazingly Powerful People Are Born Superstrong Makes You Not So Amazingly Hilarious
T-Rex: Okay
God: LISTEN T-REX I DIDN'T
God: I MADE IT SO YOU CAN SAY THAT
