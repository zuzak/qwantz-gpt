Narrator: COMPRESSED SONG COMICS
T-Rex: I'm so happy that I have the BEST idea for a science fiction movie. It's called - "The Place Where Friends Gather".

T-Rex: It stars James LaRue as Professor Science, and he's going to hunt down a SPIDER-MAN duplicate.

T-Rex: And he has a SPIDER-MAN duplicate, and he can't get a SPIDER-MAN duplicate to join him, so he teams up with another member of the opposite sex to track down a SPACESHIPER duplicate.  Oh! AND, at the end, the SPACESHIPER takes the other two people down to the last known location of the last known SPIDER-MAN.

T-Rex: It's a beautiful scene!
Utahraptor: It's not as beautiful as the movie needs to be!

T-Rex: It still has the same boring plot holes, but -
T-Rex: It has the perfect scene!
Utahraptor: Yes!

Narrator: GOOD MOVIE PROTEOS: add your own captions; movies need more than one entry; movies with more than one entry are called "MAKE YOUR OWN MOVIE TITLES".
T-Rex: Okay! That certainly is the consensus!
