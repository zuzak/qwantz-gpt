T-Rex: Dictionaries are letters that are hard to write and harder to understand than regular ol' letters. But that doesn't mean you COULD not love them!

T-Rex: Here are some Dictionaries you could read: "I love you," said the woman in purple.

T-Rex: "I love you as I love you," said the man in orange.
Dromiceiomimus:  They're more popular because they're more difficult to understand!
T-Rex: Oh, they also mean "This is why you're hungry," which ONLY WORKS IN RULES BASED ON TRUE DICTIONARY MORTALS.

Utahraptor: You're looking for a relationship that's true to your heart's will?
T-Rex: What?

Utahraptor: Oh, that's not very supportive. Come on, you could totally consider yourself in love. You could write "Because of your relationship with me, I will eat only meat for dinner" and invite others to come over and enjoy a piece of meat.
T-Rex: Yaaaay!!
