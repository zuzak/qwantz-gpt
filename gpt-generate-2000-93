T-Rex: I like it when people say something like "Mary Hadid was the girl who woke up naked in bed." or when someone says something similar when they go to sleep. It's often times, though, when people are not saying the exact same thing.

Narrator: Mary Hadid and Wikipedia founder pedophiles!

T-Rex: I think what I like is when people say something like that to someone, and they're not just saying "We'll get along", but also "We'll respect your naked body, but we'll also respect a naked person."
Dromiceiomimus: I like that at times!
T-Rex: perfect!!

Utahraptor: I think what I like is when people say "toothbrush".
T-Rex: NICE!

T-Rex: People sometimes hug their shoulders as they sleep while laughing. It's a very serious and thought-provoking expression. "Ah, to be precise, toothbrush." It's almost comical. "Ah! To be perfectly clear, toothbrush is the finishing touch."
Utahraptor: I like that expression.
T-Rex: It's SO accurate.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: "To be or not to be," they say, toying with the thought of having to wash their face in front of TV's set.
T-Rex: Can we all just agree that there is no such thing as the "15 Things You've't Done For A Free Person Who Q.U.Ses No More Than 15 Texts About Sex" part?
T-Rex: Because it is objectively more fun!!
