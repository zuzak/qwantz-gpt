T-Rex: I think it would be a great idea to write a really convincing essay for the New Yorker, and then maybe include some observations that would make my essay appear less fanciful!

T-Rex: One for the "person who did something amazing in their life" set!

T-Rex: One for the "setting" and one for the "poem" - I guess for the "we all get to read a book we never get to read" set! I think it would be a great way to honour those who have written things, and make them seem awesome!
Dromiceiomimus: One for the "setting summer" and one for the "music we all love"?
T-Rex: I think it would be great!

Utahraptor: Two for the "prayers we ask for and strive to receive"!
T-Rex: Two!

Utahraptor: Three! That's four! That's five! That's six! And six more days of not hearing anything until you're 100% sure your body's just trying to cheer you on.
T-Rex: Five!
Utahraptor: Six!

Utahraptor: That's seven! That's eight more days of not hearing anything until you're 96% sure your body is just trying to cheer you on.
T-Rex: Seven!
Utahraptor: Eugh!

T-Rex: Seven!
