T-Rex:  One day, some guy named "Gregory" published a magazine cover featuring a cartoonish drawing of a dog soggy from his horse back up to his crotch.  He also wrote "bogus" on the front, so readers knew he was a dog from the seventies!

T-Rex:  BOGUS.

T-Rex:  "Gregory" said "k" in the last sentence of the magazine, so "Gregory" would be "k" on the cover!  "Gregory" wrote "dogs go in dogs go out" on the last page!  And in the last sentence of the magazine, "Gregory"'s blood pressure was shown to be way above the mark!  "Gregory" died a few months later!  THE END.

Utahraptor:  But people kept inventing times and getting different readings on things like this!
T-Rex:  Oh!!

T-Rex:  So the magazine got a nuclear power plant and on its first page, it says "today's the day when we warm up to the oxygen we so and so eat at".  And in the top left half of the magazine, there is a picture of a woman holding a soda with a dog behind her, and in the second half of the magazine, there is a picture of a man soggy from his horse, and THEN, he writes "shit, I sould actually like to say it right now."

T-Rex:  I doddle this story into my SPACE IMAGERY SERIES and DRAGONS&#8220;??
Space IMaginary:  Pfft.  Star Trek doesn't need to make that comparison.
T-Rex:  I demand even more Star Trek episodes from the future!!
