T-Rex: So! I've been practicing humility, and this morning I was pleased to find I actually did actually do actually do something!

T-Rex: I found that I actually did TRULY practice it, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: ...Okay, so you do kind of take things in-universe, T-Rex, but not quite in-kindly.
T-Rex: Sometimes I'll say things like "Forsooth! I had none of THAT, sir!" or "Again, I have a good sense of how things work".
Dromiceiomimus: ...Oh.

T-Rex: That's not a real thing!
Utahraptor: It can be used as a self-help book!

T-Rex: "If you're going to the White Horse you should get a book with advice on how things should be done."
Utahraptor: " advice on how to be the man who acts on others."
T-Rex: That's not a real thing!

T-Rex: That's something I should have on my shelf at all times; I don't want to take it on the chin!
T-Rex: "As a friend, I appreciate the time you're putting into writing this letter, but it's too late for me now that you're ending this relationship now!"
T-Rex: That's not a real thing!
