T-Rex: Aw, come on. I'm not.

T-Rex: I'm gonna fake it and say I'm serious!

T-Rex: I've just been thinking about the issue of tax subsidies, Dromiceiomimus. About the way the government allocates tax dollars. About the way government agencies work.
Dromiceiomimus: You're thinking in terms of building bridges between government and the people!
T-Rex: That's what I'm going to say. What am I going to swear?
Dromiceiomimus: I'm not.

T-Rex: I'm going to stop talking! I'm not.
Utahraptor: You're going to stop talking?

T-Rex: Yep!
Utahraptor: Yeah, stop.
T-Rex: You can't just "just stop talking". That's not how it works.
