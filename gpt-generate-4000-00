T-Rex: Oh crap I ate a bunch and then I was worried I had come down with the mumps!

T-Rex: ... and then I ate a whole lot and then I was SAD!

T-Rex: Alright, so this guy is a tough guy. He's got big piles of stuff to take him on. I don't want to have to go through life with a life that doesn't feature any kind of peace and love!
Dromiceiomimus: You were thinking about your piles and the fact that yours is basically a giant heap on the floor.
T-Rex: Hah!
T-Rex: ...Alright, FINE. You're no longer a pile on the floor, my friend. You're a happy pile that I rescued from the bottom!

Utahraptor: Hey T-Rex, did you say you're a pile on the floor?
T-Rex: No, but I rescued you!

Utahraptor: Yeah man. You sure saved yourself some trouble.
T-Rex: ...
Utahraptor: ...Okay. Thanks.
T-Rex: Sweet.

Narrator: EARLIER:
T-Rex: My pile of food, it turns out, is actually a pretty tiny pile on the floor!
God: T-REX YOU'RE A POOCHASE
T-Rex: Awww, suck on us!!
