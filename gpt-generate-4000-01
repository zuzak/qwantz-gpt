T-Rex: Zombies! Everyone loves zombies. They're the ultimate consumerism and the ultimate consumer for an entirely imagined and created reality. Everyone loves them just as much as everyone else does!!

T-Rex: But what if we weren't sure that zombies were just doing the zombie thing?

T-Rex: Maybe if we had the same sense of taste as everyone else, we'd get all the tasty things! Maybe if we had the technology, we'd let the zombified bodies of people trapped in zombie society decay instead! Maybe if we saw the zombified bodies of people who would otherwise be dead as zombies, we'd encode that experience in the laws of taste and reproduction!

Utahraptor: Okay, I guess if taste is developed by and for the people who did EVERYTHING the rest of us didn't develop it!
T-Rex: FINE.

T-Rex: You developed it by not a zombie like us, but by DESCRIBING the rest of us into submission!
Utahraptor: Come on imaginationry, if the rest of us were more inventive we wouldn't be able to tell.
T-Rex: Man!

T-Rex: This is what's awesome about being made to feel bad about ourselves if we put too much value on a given experience!
T-Rex: The key is not just to imagine what the rest of us are thinking, but to only value the past you and I imagine for a moment!
