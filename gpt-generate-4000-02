T-Rex: What day of the week is it?  IT'S NOT IMPORTANT, because this is just statistical estimations!

Narrator: THE OLD WEST

T-Rex: The time of day where all is well in the Middle Kingdom is the time where there was a definite king on the throne, and he gave this up for the common defence.  He was a constant King, constantly working to improve the state of the world.  He was this guy who said "let's get more out of our stupid gold-plated pegs".

Utahraptor: The day where the world ended and everyone lived in ice cream machines.
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: That's where things got interesting.  Nobody now lived in the even ice cream-crazier days of "The Future King"!  The place of origin of this is no longer relevant.  The place of origin of this is no longer IMPOSSIBLE.  I have a solution!
Utahraptor: And it's a winner?
T-Rex: A king uses his position as king to constrain the actions of another!

T-Rex: Huh?  Who'd've thought that?  I guess he was all, "I'm just going to make better decisions with more cheese"?
T-Rex: I'm afraid that is not the point.
T-Rex: I'm now no longer a king, and the world began to collapse.
