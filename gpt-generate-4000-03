T-Rex: My new book is a collection of fairy tales.

T-Rex: A collection of fairy tales that all happen to be true fairy tales!

T-Rex: For instance, Cinderella is a true tale!
T-Rex: Cinderella actually has troubles on her own, because she's a fake girl who does not exist.
T-Rex: But check it out: she's a real girl who doesn't actually exist!
T-Rex: And it's not even fair that she's a girl, because a) she's a girl, too, and b) she's a girl.

Utahraptor: Well, if she's a boy it's more like a boy, or a boy who is -
T-Rex: Impossible to FIND OUT.

T-Rex: Well, here's what happened: I realized I could build a physical body that is girl-shaped, but also girl-shaped!
Utahraptor: So if I'm a boy, I'm not as girl-sized as I used to be. But if I'm a girl, I'm still basically the same size as a boy.
T-Rex: Sweet!

T-Rex: Okay, so! My book is a collection of girl-sized Diary of a Teenager.
T-Rex: A diary that looks just like
T-Rex: Diary of a Teenager.
T-Rex: (It is, in fact, a book)
