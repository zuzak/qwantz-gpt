T-Rex: Everyone!
T-Rex: You guys!

T-Rex: Who's got anything else to do tonight?

T-Rex: Well, actually -
Utahraptor: Why not come back?
T-Rex: I am! I did not invent colour-drenched people in t-Rex costumes.
Utahraptor: That's ridiculous! You can make ANY colour palatable by just replacing its hues with its own. Oh, guess what?

T-Rex: I've got nothing against you, Utahraptor!  Just, you know, keep in mind the sort of thing that wasn't there in the past.
Utahraptor: Haven't you tried?  Just -
T-Rex: Man, keep in mind, don't look at me.
