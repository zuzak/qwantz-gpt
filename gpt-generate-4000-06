Narrator: COMPRESSED SONG COMICS
Narrator: today's song
Narrator: TORN by NATALIE IMBRUGLIA

T-Rex: Nat Imbruglia has witnessed a male corpse become reanimated... OR SO SHE CLAIMS!!

T-Rex: Nat adores this Frankenstein-esque creation for several reasons, including the fact that he's warm, dignified, AND good at crying. Natalie goes on to tell anyone who will listen that they are NOT that man. She then runs out of faith, takes off all her clothes, and lies on the cold floor. It's embarrassing. It's embarrassing.

Utahraptor: Natalie Imbruglia's going through a rough patch, huh?
T-Rex: No way, man!

T-Rex: She sure could've went through some pretty rough patches. She could've tried being poor and was born with a broken heart...
Utahraptor: But she didn't.
T-Rex: What? No, of course not.
Utahraptor: Natalie Imbruglia is not shackable by reason of any previous experience. She has never wandered away from a rough patch and is now, as far as I can tell, fully capable of doing nothing!

T-Rex: That's not what I meant! I meant, like, free will over time.
T-Rex: This is what happens when you make bad decisions
