T-Rex: As of today, I am officially living in the future!

T-Rex: That's because as of TODAY, I am the proud owner of a fully functional kitchen!

T-Rex: We all know what the future will bring for culinary professionals and chefs: more processing plants, totally insane, and even octopods. More processing plants, Dromiceiomimus! More octopods.
Dromiceiomimus: More processing plants.
T-Rex: More.
T-Rex: More.

Utahraptor: Are we really going to live in the "living room" future?
T-Rex: We sure are!

T-Rex: And yet, I don't see how we can escape it. Why are we even working in it?  Why are we EVEN working in it?
Utahraptor: Are we really here??
T-Rex: Yes, as of now, SO MANY of us are.

T-Rex: And that's just the tip of the iceberg!
T-Rex: I want to hear your stories, Utahraptor, but we're sleeping in the middle of nowhere.
T-Rex: We're being kind of a slumber party, you know?
