T-Rex: What day of the week is it? Friday? Maybe even earlier?
T-Rex: OH MY GOD

God: SERIOUSLY MAN I NEED TO TALK ABOUT VIDEO GAMES FOR A STORY T-REX
T-Rex: Okay!

T-Rex: Okay, so the issue is that most of the world doesn't watch Friday night, so they can have fun and watch me talk about the positive benefits of video games! But I saw your comic and it turns out women are more effective than men at games!
Dromiceiomimus: It's for the gender-neutral noun "game", T-Rex.
T-Rex: Man. I saw it and it turns out I'm still trying to figure out gender relations!

Utahraptor: I think it's pretty clear that you just did an amazing job.
T-Rex: I AM STUNNED.

T-Rex: I'd love to see your hilarious but ultimately sassy stories, like the one I just saw, in which the camera rolls, the narrative is lost in thoughtless distraction.
Utahraptor: I can't!
T-Rex: The spotlight never moves on you, dear friend! THE LIGHT ONS YOUR LITTLE SOCK.

T-Rex: Oh, what a beautiful, game-changing scene in the middle of a sizzling scene. Satisfied!
T-Rex: And filled with intrigue and promise!
