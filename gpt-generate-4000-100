T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for talking about my love...

T-Rex: ...my love of TOMATOMS.

T-Rex: Oh! Oh, wow. I almost forgot that talking about love is really boring.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm still thinking about love in surprising ways, T-Rex!
T-Rex: You're welcome!
T-Rex: Just a heads up: I'm talking about the other awesome things that can happen when you talk about love! The Bard's talking about it too, you know?

Utahraptor: That's pretty awesome, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's true!

Utahraptor: Well, I guess I was still left wanting more love, even from a heterosexual man. Not bad, I guess. But I think it's more important than ever that we allow the free exercise of love, and the very intimacy of friendship.
T-Rex: It's true! I guess I should step away and make some cupcakes!

Narrator: THE NEXT DAY
T-Rex: Oh, not again!!
