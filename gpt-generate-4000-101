Narrator: THE DIFFERENCE LIE BIT
T-Rex: One day Timmy got a lielegram from a friend!

T-Rex: He was a sailor who did not have a ship.

T-Rex: But when he sailed up to America, he found a merchant ship with boarded and delivered citizens to America. Once he had these ships, he sailed up to a monarch who wanted his citizens, and specifically, his ex-wife. The deception worked, and soon Timmy was working as a mechanic, passing on new innovations to the new owners.

Utahraptor: But before he could even begin his trade, a pirate appeared and offered to trade him 30,000 dollars.
T-Rex: (whispering) Oh my God!!

T-Rex: The pirates wanted 40,000 dollars but could not afford the technology to pull it off. So Timmy and his crew sailed to the moon, where they made a crude bridge to the stupid king.
Utahraptor: There, Timmy and his crew revealed to the king that a magic lamp was held to blow up the kingdom!

T-Rex: The magic lamp blew up, and the king was forced to pay the pirates a new dowry!
Utahraptor: No, this is not the real world, T-Rex. This is... THE MIZUANA.
T-Rex: R... S ...
T-Rex: THE ULTIMATE MIZUANA, AND ALSO THE GREATEST MIZUANA WOULD YOU WISH.
