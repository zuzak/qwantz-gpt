T-Rex: A prison organizes a wilderness trip for its inmates, and when that fails, the inmates struggle and fall in love with the good fellow they have.  But better than that...

T-Rex: ...than that which is made flesh?

T-Rex: And this makes them into a beautiful people!  So we should be careful what we wish for, Dromiceiomimus!  Too often, we make our characters feel like we're one big character.  We forget that even in our most private moments, we just want to do our lines.  We don't let our characters off the hook.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm sure we can grow some garden gnomes though!

Utahraptor: Yeah, and I'm certain there'd be more plants for everyone!
T-Rex: And more plants for the woods?

Utahraptor: Yep!  And another forest for the characters, when they need to do their lines, and I honestly don't see how they manage.
T-Rex: That's exactly my point!  Someone needs to look up "nudity" in the dictionary!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Everyone needs to get their own garden gnome garden this year!
T-Rex: ...Go ahead!
T-Rex: I just want my garden!
