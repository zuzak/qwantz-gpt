T-Rex: I have determined something exciting! Brace yourselves, for what I have found is a sad but true History of WAR!

T-Rex: Here is a sad but true Tale of Two Cities, where everyone's fighting in giant metal drums!

T-Rex: The winner is the Champion of Metal Drum, who, as in the other Metal Drum Wars, pits everyone in the arena against a clock-tower-style death trap!
Dromiceiomimus: Assuming they're not enemies, though, Dromiceiomimus, you win! The metal drums are for friendship!
T-Rex: Ho ho! What's for snore?
Dromiceiomimus: Not much!

T-Rex: Oh, just one: the best way to victory is to make all your friends end up in a giant metal drum as well!
Utahraptor: Again?

T-Rex: Yep! The metal drums are for war!
Utahraptor: Assuming they're not enemies, though, you win! The metal drums are for war AND love!
T-Rex: NICE.
Utahraptor: Assuming they're not enemies, you win! The metal drums are for love and death AND life AND the way you think!

Narrator: NOTE: METAPHORICS ARE INTENDED FOR DEPTH CONVENTION SPOILER CHANGES; ARTISTS USE A BATCHION OF ARTISTS THAT ARE JUST FEW REMAINED FROM OTHER SCIENCE CORPSES SPOILER ALERT!
Narrator: NOTE 2: METAPHORIC USE ONLY: in this comic's teaser, the title is actually just "and then we don't see how it's better" and the rest of the film is a complicated montage of slow motion.
