T-Rex: Anthropomorphism is when you have things that normally get eaten by animals, but turn to flesh for eating! The end!

Narrator: IF THERE'S AN ANIMAL ON THE PLANET, I DON'T THINK IT CAN DO ANYTHING

T-Rex: But I have a solution! I just THINK it would be awesome to be able to eat flesh from pretty much any animal, and NOT be SOOKABLE for a few hours afterwards! That is for the very low price of Meat-centric cultural relativism!
Dromiceiomimus: You THINK like that?
T-Rex: Heck yeah!meat isn't even meaty at all!

Utahraptor: That's not what you meant, T-Rex!
T-Rex: What? It's not even "pretty"?

Utahraptor: Not meaty at all!
T-Rex: That's not even 'cept what you think meat is. Meat is basically just animal matter that's been minced or mashed up. Vegetarians use it as a deglobalident.
Utahraptor: Ah. Well. That's not a bad idea.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE PLANET:
T-Rex: So what do you think of my 'harmonious' theory?
T-Rex: I think it's good
