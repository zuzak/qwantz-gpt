T-Rex: Imagine if we had a beach ball to swim in?  No matter what you do, you'll find a way!

T-Rex: You'll wonder why we feel the need to 'sunset walk' all the time!

Dromiceiomimus: Okay, T-Rex, what are you going to do to prevent that from happening?  Why do we feel the need to swim in?  Why not just make it a favourite sport of your parents?
T-Rex:  Because -
Dromiceiomimus: - because sport?
T-Rex:  Because we value teamwork above all else!

Utahraptor: SPORTS?
T-Rex:  Yes!  I will play sports!

T-Rex:  I'm going to demonstrate!  I'm going to make a positive impact!
Utahraptor:  I'm going to dedicate a day to developing the skills and adaptability necessary to compete on this great planet.

T-Rex:  Yes!  I'm going to dedicate a week to developing the skills and adaptability necessary to run a successful team of athletes!
Utahraptor:  Yes!
T-Rex:  Utahraptor, get it?  We're not motivated!
Utahraptor:  Not yet!
T-Rex:  We're going to dedicate a day to developing the skills and adaptability necessary to run successful teams of athletes, you know?
