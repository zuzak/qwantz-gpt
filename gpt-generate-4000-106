Narrator: YOU ARE GREAT
Narrator: a web card

T-Rex: Dear recipient of this comic:

T-Rex: Whoever sent this to you thinks you are great!

T-Rex: Let's assume this person is a guy. Boy, does he ever like you! He likes you so much he lets someone else do his writing for him and uses pre-nup to pay the bill. He also likes you who keeps your name out of the news. He thinks you should be doing your writing for him, and he probably expects a "great work" from you.

Utahraptor: What if this is all a dream?
T-Rex: Oh, just a thought for you Utahraptor!

T-Rex: Utahraptor, please keep this card in your email when you go to work and you make sure your name is announced when you go to the office!
Utahraptor: You seem to be having a great time today!
T-Rex: Yes, and please keep this card in your email when you go to the office AND when you go to break for a cup of tea!

Narrator: SORRY WE WENT A LITTLE LONGER TO GET YOUR DATES OUT:
T-Rex: Not bad, not bad! But awkward!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: *sigh*
