Narrator: COMPRESSED ORIGIN STORY COMICS
Narrator: Today's origin story: BATMAN

T-Rex: Well, I'm perfectly content!

T-Rex: I may be a bit idle, a bit unfocused, but at least I haven't had a night where all sense left my life! That's for darn sure! Incidentally, criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot!

Utahraptor: Want to go to the cinema, son? "The Mark of Zorro" is playing!
T-Rex: Oh boy!

Utahraptor: Can you get mom to wear her pearl necklace? It's been a pleasure to see you again!
T-Rex: I know! And it's for darn sure! Also, "The Mark of Zorro" is playing, "The Mark of the Dinosaur".
Utahraptor: That's "The Mark of the Plank".
T-Rex: Oh my goodness!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: My high school guidance counsellors were having a homosexual affair!
Utahraptor: Yaaaaay
