T-Rex: What a nice surprise!

T-Rex: I noticed myself when I closed my eyes and I said "I think mind can do both." But what I really meant was that it was time for me to do things independently.
T-Rex: So I did what any good vampire would do - I did what any good vampire would do: I embarked on a life-changing adventure!

Utahraptor: Well, T-Rex, what are your plans for the night?
T-Rex: Uh...ahem...nightmare?

T-Rex: I guess!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Um, I'm not sure if it's possible to have desires at the same time.
Utahraptor: Or at least, not fully accept that you have them at the same time.
T-Rex: I guess!
