T-Rex: I guess I've been pretty good at sneaking around with a snare, but I've been making snare noises! I can't be in the house listening in!

T-Rex: See, if you were snore into my ear, would you be let loose in the kitchen?

T-Rex: I would enjoy the taste of sound in my ears, as I try to make myself heard. But if I were snore into your ear, would you be letting loose in your tastebuds with such skill that I miss your old song?
Dromiceiomimus: I would prefer that you listen to Something More Personal, rather than watching television shows and doing your own thing.
T-Rex: I find that encouraging.

Utahraptor: I find that reassuring.
T-Rex: Yeah, but isn't that something the rest of us should do all the time?

Utahraptor: Well, instead of me excreting music, maybe you should just get a drum soloed?
T-Rex: I can already hear the beats!
Utahraptor: I think you're not going to find me trim.

T-Rex: See? I've been looking for a drum soloed friend in the woods!
Utahraptor: I can assure you that for many, many words, I will be able to provide the style and advice.
T-Rex: Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: Excellent!
