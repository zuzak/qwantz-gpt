T-Rex: I have faith in random developments of chance of an otherwise-uncommon nature. It may be that I do not apprehend enough of these events in detail, and, therefore, cannot make the observation, much less make the comparison, between two different people and places!

T-Rex: There is no such thing as random chance!

T-Rex: And this I hold fast to the principles of regularity and consistency.
Dromiceiomimus: Well then I'd better get on with my day, as this is a necessary step towards assuring myself of that.
T-Rex: I will endeavour.

T-Rex: There is no such thing as random chance in the entire universe as there are in "A Bachelors", as there are in "The Nose Full of Rye"!
Utahraptor: Nice.

Utahraptor: In fact I think we can all pretty easily agree that there is no such thing as much "random" as "1: Okay, that's a straight line", and that it's not REALLY worth noting.
T-Rex: Nice. Utahraptor, I'll ensure you it's not! It's a straight line.

Narrator: SOME YEAR OREGRE CAME UP FROM THE COMPUTER UNIVERSE AND WAS WALKING DOWN A STONE-NATURAL path?
T-Rex: Nice. Nice.
T-Rex: So Dromiceiomimus, you've travelled back in time to chat her up, right?
T-Rex: Sure have.
T-Rex: And I've made sure that I'm always up to something, whenever I go. It's called ES@W!
T-Rex: In fact, that means that I'm always up to something!
