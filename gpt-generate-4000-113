T-Rex: I have been thinking, and I have come up with a way to become immortal!

T-Rex: A way to become immortal is to be immortal as long as you're not going to die someday!

T-Rex: Something like, every time you die you're immortal, and then you're super safe going to sleep where you're super sleepy because every bit of your immortality is guaranteed.
Utahraptor: And how!

Utahraptor: You're going to be immortal for the rest of your life, anyway.
T-Rex: Oh man, I totally know! I know every bit of my ultimate self is going to be immortal, and I've laid out a set of plans for each one of us to become immortal for the rest of our lives!

T-Rex: I'll tell you what they'll be, but tell you what: we've got to do it.
T-Rex: We're going to do it, Utahraptor!!

T-Rex: Okay! We're going to do it, but we're also going to automate all of our day-to-day lives, and we're going to let computers do all the work for us.
T-Rex: What do you mean by that?
Utahraptor: A little thing called "Act Like A Computer"?!
T-Rex: Hah! I seriously don't think that's cuter than a regular computer!

T-Rex: I mean realitively: when talking about yourself, you're talking about your personal hell, and I think that's a big deal.
Utahraptor: Ah. I get it. I thought it was something to do with your dog!
T-Rex: Well, I guess I'm just HAD to let your crazy ideas run free through my kitchen as often as possible though.
