Narrator: INCORRECT HOMOPHONE COMICS
T-Rex: Two words that are homophones sound the same but mean different things!

T-Rex: For instance: the word "awful" (really bad) and the word "offal" (burchered entrails)!

T-Rex: To begin: my stomping on this manner is a sorted little affair! Take soulless in the fact that at leased ewe are knot being chaste as well!
Dromiceiomimus: Why are you charring me, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I'm just trying to out sing you!

Utahraptor: I'm trying to be charmed by you!
T-Rex: I'm not!

Utahraptor: I do believe you are. What, you just slip into a good thing and then pull back the curtain a little?
T-Rex: Oh! I do believe you're doing that which only a charmed person would do.
Utahraptor: I'm not sure what you're tal-
Utahraptor: I'm sure I don't!

Narrator: NOT MUCH:
T-Rex: I'm trying to pull away from you and move away from you, you know?
T-Rex: *gasp*
T-Rex: Oh my goodness!
T-Rex: That wasn't meant to be a joke!
