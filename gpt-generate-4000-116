T-Rex: How come it's not cool anymore? I look around and see lots of stomping on the poor woman with the expression on my face!

T-Rex: I'd love to find out how things looked on the poor woman!

T-Rex: Perhaps you'd remind me how the lightbulbs were invented in the early morning, and how they still work to the hilt after the lights are on? I don't want to live in the past. I want to make sure that, during the day, things are as they were before.

Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex, do you want to come over today and help with the laundry?
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: Excellent! As you always did, Utahraptor, you should come over today and help with the laundry.
Utahraptor: Okay! As soon as the lights are on, I'll come out and help!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Excellent! I'll come out and help!
