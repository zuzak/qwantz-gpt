T-Rex: Historically speaking, all I know are broad stereotypes! For instance, most people in the Middle Ages didn't want to be called "The Gambler" or "The Ghost".

T-Rex: That's their right?

T-Rex: The stereotype's good, because it applies to both them and us, as a people. It's the only one we've got, and it applies to both us and / or, in the case of us, a Ghost.
Dromiceiomimus: "The Gambler" also applies to old people, who didn't want to be called "The Gambler" or "The Ghost".
T-Rex: Hah! What a handy way to end a narrative!

Utahraptor: "The Ghost".
T-Rex: No, really! It doesn't imply that they're bad people.

Utahraptor: But they're not bad people, T-Rex! "The Gambler" is already out of fashion.
T-Rex: But they're not! They're:
T-Rex: THE HOLY GABRILE??

T-Rex: A HOLY GABRILE THAT TAKES PLACE IN CIVILIZATION: a mute and the silent majority unable to hear!
Utahraptor: Ah.
T-Rex: Perhaps in Last We Were Alive, we'd all become ghosts, unable to understand our fallen world and unable or unwilling to grasp the concept of immortality.

T-Rex: Ah.
