T-Rex: A prison organizes a wilderness trip for its inmates, and when that fails, the inmates come back for more!

T-Rex: So the whole prison organizes a trip for its inmates, and when that fails, the inmates come back for more!

T-Rex: So what's the deal with... a three-day breakfiesta for its inmates?
Dromiceiomimus: That's a terrible idea, T-Rex! All those fireside chats would be a good omen!
T-Rex: I'm not so sure!

Utahraptor: That's exactly what the Dromiceiomimus was thinking!
T-Rex: I said, exactly!

Utahraptor: Well, I agree, and I think it's kind of brilliant, that instead of a three day breakfiesta, we should instead do a one-day-a-week excursion... to a world-class site!
T-Rex: To visit a world-class site, of COURSE, I know where I want to go! But to do that, I need more pleasure!

Narrator: (IN THIS ONE PARALLEL FACT: a world-class faubar, in full view of your mirror, which, incidentally, is also your brooding, weeping, confused, confused beauty!)

T-Rex: To visit a world-class faubar, ab you, in the distance, through smoke and mirrors, who appear to be members of an opposing religion, fighting for the soul!
God: SEE T-REX THIS IS WHY I'M PLAYING GAMES
T-Rex: It's complicated, but the fun thing is actually simple: I'm putting myself out there!
