T-Rex: Yes, children are born free from parental responsibility!

T-Rex: Because they're free from parental responsibility!

T-Rex: Yes, that means that free will is free from compromise! That means that free judgements are free from dispute! That means that free judgements CAN be made, but they must always be free from impositions; that is, they must always be free from impositions that are unjust.
T-Rex: Free will is therefore an anion that governs the course of society!

Utahraptor: That's a pretty alright theory, isn't it?
T-Rex: I know, and it does!

Utahraptor: It's just that some ideas have an anion that's okay, while others share a anion that's not so okay. You can't apply an anion that works for ALL ideas, even free will!
T-Rex: Well, I guess I'm free from any special interests!
Utahraptor: I will not!

Narrator: SHORTLY:
T-Rex: free will is an anion that EVERYONE draws, EVERY SINGLE PERSON THERE.
T-Rex: Free will is an anion that EVERYONE spits out a fisticuffs about utahraptor
