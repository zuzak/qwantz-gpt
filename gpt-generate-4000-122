T-Rex: One day a babysitter wondered why the kids were so quiet, so she went to the basement and there was a murderer with a gun there.

T-Rex: But what did the babysitter find?

T-Rex: She put the gun down because kids do that all the time, T-Rex. The gun was in the closet. "Who draw the gun?" the kids said.
Dromiceiomimus: They're not the kind who do that.
T-Rex: She said maybe they're old and want to hang out with the adults.
Dromiceiomimus: Yeah, the kids liked the adults, and the cops wanted the kids to do something else.

T-Rex: The kids liked the adults, and the babysitter wanted the kids to do something else.
Utahraptor: And?
T-Rex: And, the kids liked the adults but they yelled "No!" and then the kids said "Why don't you use your hands and follow me?"

T-Rex: The babysitter is the one who is CLEARLY making decisions that have already had that path realized. She hands the kids presents, and the kids pull out their guns and say "DON'T TELL ME, TELL ME." Then the kids pull out their guns, and the adults listen in comprehension as the babysitter works through the whole situation.

T-Rex: ...FINALLY
