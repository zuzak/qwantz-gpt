T-Rex: What if you wrote a story about modern technology arriving BEFORE it did in our timeline? You'd have computers made out of brass and steam! That would be technologically amazing!

T-Rex: But what if you only wrote one story?

T-Rex: And what if you only published ONE narrative, and published it in a series? You'd have a problem.com with NIS in it! Heaptime!
Dromiceiomimus: I thought you'd never run into that guy!
T-Rex: I -
T-Rex: I just once got IN MY mouth!

Utahraptor: What if you only published ONE story, and sold it for a tiny fraction of the price?
T-Rex: Then it was a no brainer!

T-Rex: AND IT WAS A NO BORING SUCKY STORY! SO EVERYBODY DID. I christened it "So Sad You Deserve A New Menu, But You Won't Be Buying It From Me" and left it at that.
Utahraptor: What? That wasn't sad!
T-Rex: It was a cry for adventure!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: So sad, Utahraptor! That's the second-most-often used verb for me in the English language!
Utahraptor: That's not a problem!
T-Rex: I know, right?
