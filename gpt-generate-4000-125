T-Rex: "The food is delicious!" said Antonio! "You can't get enough."

T-Rex: "That's a little OLD to be OBVIOUSLY RECIPIENT."

Utahraptor: "No", Antonio said, "it's me, you!"
T-Rex: "Again. I'm someone you can rely on."

Utahraptor: "Again. I'm someone you can rely on though."
T-Rex: "Again. I'm someone you can rely on though."

T-Rex: "Again. I'm someone you can rely on though."
