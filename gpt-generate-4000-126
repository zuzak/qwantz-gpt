T-Rex: I am a guy who just plain loves parties.  Sure, I get excited!  Or, for that matter: heated!

T-Rex: I just don't get it.

T-Rex: How do I know MY tastes? How do I know what my opinions are?  Well, Dromiceiomimus, I'll give you an idea: an elementary number of parties.
Dromiceiomimus: That sounds like like a lot of parties!
T-Rex: Okay, yeah it is like a lot of parties!  A lot of parties!

Utahraptor: The number of elementary parties is obviously finite, T-Rex!  How many parties does it take to make a person like you?
T-Rex: O-Okay, that's it!  A number that's probably much larger than yours.

Utahraptor: Okay, you're done then.  How many people do you think are alive today?
T-Rex: Hah!  Perhaps they were all this afternoon?  Fine, I'm moving to a new town and I want to party!
Utahraptor: Man, I think you got this one wrong.
T-Rex: Not by a long shot!  These days I... keep an eye on me, Natives!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: These days into the very tip of my tongue, I ride the waves of the ocean!
T-Rex: That is a course the size of my head
