Narrator: HOW TO USE TWITTER
T-Rex: Twitter is a cool social network because complete strangers can message you at any time, and there's no way to turn that off!!

T-Rex: So Here's how to get started on Twitter!

T-Rex: First You'll need to choose a name. All names on Twitter start with an "@", so a good name might be @cooldude, except that's taken, as is @coolguy, @guywhoiscool, @cooltwitterguy, and @heyilike2becool.
T-Rex: Instead, fall back to your original name, @coolkitten, which will be @kilotheokee, except that's taken, as will @coolguy, who will be @kilotheokey.

T-Rex: Instead, pitch in and make a new name. Instead of @coolcat, make @coolflower, except that's taken, as will @coolestone, who will be @flowerweed.
Utahraptor: You can't just use "flower" though.

T-Rex: Well, pretty much everyone except for you can do that, and "flower" is the easiest name to come up with. All you need is an email address!!
Utahraptor: So your name is @katelynoddudeon90@aol.com.
T-Rex: THAT'S WHAT I'VE ANSWERED!!
Utahraptor: SOFLESH MY NAME, HOW DO YOU DO IT??
T-Rex: HELLNOW

T-Rex: HELLO

T-Rex: HOW DO YOU GET IN PLACE OF A RHETORICAL DUEL BY JUSTIFYING IT WITH THE OTHER DUEL
T-Rex: THAT WAS ONE OF THE WORDS I USED TO FIND OUT
