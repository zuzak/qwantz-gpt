T-Rex:  I think I have sex addiction, but like, for food!  Is it because of me?  Or was it because of everyone else?

T-Rex:  I don't know!  Maybe I just feel like an addiction, but who I am now really complicated, for sure!

T-Rex:  And that means that there is a sex addiction for everyone!
T-Rex:  We should all get used to it!

Utahraptor:  Is there any advice, T-Rex?
T-Rex:  I have never been called such a dude!

Utahraptor:  Well, that does it for my weird answer.  Do you - you think you should be making jokes about being called a Dromiceiomimus?
T-Rex:  I am simply trying to get used to the word "doll" when describing people's bodies!

T-Rex:  For instance, the woman who treated me in hospital could not help but remarking on my modesty could cause my embarrassment!
T-Rex:  That, my friends, is attractive!
