T-Rex: Here are a few: when you double your life expectancy, increase your chances of death, and then live for a while, you're doing something wrong.  But if you live longer, you're SNOWBOARDING down the hill from a future supermassive black hole.  And NOW, multiply that number by the life-threatening amount you'd expect from a future supermassive black hole.

Utahraptor: That's fatal to all but the most deadly supermassive black holes!
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: Now multiply the black hole's mass by the speed of light, and then you've got a probability of becoming a ghost over time.
Utahraptor: That's a lot of jokes around here, though!
T-Rex: That's what I'm saying!
