T-Rex: I'm no longer a mere person, cats and kittens. I'm a PERSONAL BRAND. Say goodbye to boring old T-Rex...

T-Rex: ...and say hello to the new, sexy and exciting - SURGE!

Dromiceiomimus: "Surge."
T-Rex: Yes, "Surge"! It says "dynamic". It says "power". And now YOU can say things like "Gentlemen: I've got the urge... to SURGE!!"
T-Rex: You know, before you call me up or whatever!

Utahraptor: I dunno, I think I liked "T-Rex" better!
T-Rex: Impossible!

T-Rex: "Surge" is a way stronger brand! You know what Surge is, Utahraptor? It's the tastiest burger you ever ate, mixed in with your favourite musician who just got better, mixed in with next year's car models. This summer, get the urge. Surge.
Utahraptor: Well, T-REX, I'm going home.
