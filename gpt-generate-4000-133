T-Rex: I have a great idea for a comic you guys!

[[Blank panel]]

T-Rex: Okay so there's a single panel with three naked dudes in a jar, and then we go on to the next panel, where we have a totally-sexy naked DUDES.
Dromiceiomimus: Let's have two panels on the same page!
T-Rex: RIGHT.  Hah hah.  Let's do it!  Let's do it RIGHT NOW.

Utahraptor: How do we even know which panels are selffetic?
T-Rex: Easy!

T-Rex: We all have finite lifetimes, and nothing makes us more likely to join hands than to tear each other's clothes off with their naked bodies.  So it's not really erotic.  It's really just a matter of doing our bit to ensure public health and safety.
Utahraptor: I'm not convinced that's ethical!

Narrator: SEARCH SIGN: NAKED ASK PRACTICE FOR INGREDIENT ME
T-Rex: Any suggestion?
T-Rex: Man!  I can't figure out how to algorithmically determine the most idiolectable panels!
