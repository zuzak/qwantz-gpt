T-Rex: What if I worked productively and creatively towards achieving my goals today?

T-Rex: That is the question!

T-Rex: For example, if I dreamt that I would have a team of Scientists working together to understand the inner workings of the universe, what does that actually look like?
Dromiceiomimus: What?  Hello!  I ask because I am interested in what you're doing in your spare time.
T-Rex: Okay.  I ask because I am interested in what you're doing in your spare time.

Utahraptor: And what if I just wanted to be scientists and not have any scientists working for me?
T-Rex: Free verse makes me want to throw up!  BABY.

Utahraptor: I believe this is one situation where the word "team" becomes a pejorative.
T-Rex: Cover your mouth, Utahraptor!  YOU ARE NOW AN UNPOPULAR HAMBLE DUDE.

T-Rex: You're now sexually attracted to other scientists while simultaneously working toward the discovery of a personal capacity for knowledge and communication.
T-Rex: Cover your mouth, dude!!
T-Rex: That's not even "you decide to be a scientist"
