T-Rex: You know what the best part of every movie ever is?  Don't say "characters and plot or whatever" because COME ON.  The best part of every movie is the HILARIOUS OUTTAKES.

T-Rex: And this sublime satisfaction need no longer be limited to film!

T-Rex: For example, books could have pages like "It is a universal truth that a single man with a large amount of fortune is in need of a life.  Hah hah, what did I write? ...'Life?'  I meant 'wife'.  Okay: new sheet of paper everyone, I promise we're gonna get this.  Ready?  We're ready? Okay.  It is a universal truth that a single man with a large amount of fortune is in need of a wifppppfft - I'm sorry! I got the giggles.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's do this."

Utahraptor: That doesn't seem that hilarious, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I GUESS YOU HAD TO BE THERE.

T-Rex: But music could do it too!  For instance, suppose the tubas played the wrong note and then everyone has to go back and start over.
Utahraptor: I think that's already done.  I think that's called "rehearsal".
T-Rex: Well it sounds great. Do the tuba players crack up when it happens?

T-Rex: Do they drop their instrument and make a funny face for the audience, then when they do it over do they hit the wrong note really loud and break up laughing again?
Utahraptor[[off]]: No, I think they get fired.
T-Rex: Man!  "Reality", am I right?
T-Rex: "Reality" sure am!
