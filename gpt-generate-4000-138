T-Rex: Hey God, would the world be an even awesomer place if everyone named "Benjamin" and "Walter" were named after famous authors instead of names that just sound like other people?)
God: HAH HAH
T-Rex: Awesomer!

Narrator: SOON!
T-Rex:Benjamin is like "WE'LL BE LIKE TELEVISION, AT WHICH POINT I HAD NOT EMAILED A PRESS RELEASE ABOUT YOUR BARE HANDS".
Utahraptor: I'm surprised at your surprise!

T-Rex: Oh my gosh, it's like when Kafka gets together with a woman and they write "I'M SORRY I AM NOT A REAL writer, but I've ALREADY GONE TO SERIOUSLY COME BACK TO MY ACHIEVEMENT WITH YOU".
Utahraptor: I like it when Kafka goes back in time.
T-Rex: It's ADVENTUROUS.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex:Also I like it when Kafka goes back in time and never gets married.
T-Rex: Bwaha.
T-Rex: What's that?  You're crazy!
