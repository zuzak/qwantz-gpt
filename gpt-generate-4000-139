T-Rex: Imagine if we had a beach ball to kick around!
T-Rex: It would be so much fun!

Imaginary T-Rex: woo! party!  [[T-Rex is imagining himself holding a beach ball, he looks so happy]]

Imaginary T-Rex: catch!
Imaginary Utahraptor: ha ha! [[both Utahraptor and T-Rex are being imagined by T-Rex]]
T-Rex: So! I intend to find a beach ball! Do you know where they are kept?
Dromiceiomimus: Sorry!
T-Rex: Maybe stomping this house will refresh your memory!

Utahraptor: I know where you could find a beach ball!
T-Rex: [[Thinks about a beach ball, really excited]]
T-Rex: Where?

Utahraptor: Ha ha, I was just pulling your leg. I don't actually care for beach balls.
Utahraptor: Or you, for that matter.

T-Rex [[thought]]: Another rejected overture towards friendship...
T-Rex [[thought]]: I really need to get inside his head!
