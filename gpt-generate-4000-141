T-Rex: I just woke up with the phrase "50 million dollar church for squirrels" stuck in my head!

T-Rex: What the heck, now?!

T-Rex: When I try to add "for squirrels", it says "For squirrels only!" But I feel it's not a very good symbol. I'm not a "50 million dollar" church, Dromiceiomimus.
Dromiceiomimus: Yeah! I felt it as a "wicked sweet scale" and a "witch with golden hair"!
T-Rex: I'm not sure how I feel about that. I used "wicked" a lot and used it as a verb, so I don't feel like I wrote "madness" with that.

Utahraptor: I feel like you are using "wicked" as a verb, T-Rex!
T-Rex: That's okay!

T-Rex: I use it not as a verb, but as a noun, and that's a metaphor. And my friends use it as well, seeing it as a substitute for "Holy crap, God!  And the Devil is using it as a verb too!"
Utahraptor: Yep!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE PARALLEL UNIVERSE:
T-Rex: ONE UNIVERSE OUT OF NUMBERS!
T-Rex: That is a demand I am willing to bear
