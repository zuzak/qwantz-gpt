God: WHAT IS UP
T-Rex: I totally don't understand!

T-Rex: I'm as confused as ever!

T-Rex: Why are there not more Spider-Fanfic about me T-Rex?
T-Rex: Because my Spider-Man fics still have problems!
T-Rex: Because they have no meaning to me!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Hey God I know a woman who won't marry the Spider-Man who only chews chews without dying!
God: NO MAN I'M INTO THAT
T-Rex: THAT'S WHAT I WAS ASKING
