Narrator: TYPES OF HATS
Narrator: a reference comic
T-Rex: Alright, let's get the easy ones out of the way first!

T-Rex: Top hats are those ones that are easy to draw!

T-Rex: You can tell by the way they poke through the fabric! The classic "horse-woman hat" from olden times! And the "crotchety" one from the '50s? Skeleton hair that's just out of style! It's not bad, except you think the hat is a little too "officially" the royal right of way to wear.
T-Rex: Hat is way better!

Utahraptor: I'm not sure if the "crotchety" hat is the correct term, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Well, if it IS, I don't know why you have to pay for it.

Utahraptor: But if I wear it casually, it's a symbol of male privilege!
T-Rex: That's your point, my friend!

T-Rex: It's a GREAT way to show that you're one of "the lucky ones" that haven't had a boring problem fixed by the "crotchety" hat!
Utahraptor: Oh man, I forgot about that one!
T-Rex: Yep! If I wear it at all, I'm SOLVED.
