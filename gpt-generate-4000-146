T-Rex: I have the greatest idea for a movie!  I've said this before but this time it's for serious.  There's this cop, right?

T-Rex: Right!

T-Rex: And he's a "by-the-books" cop who does everything "by-the-books".  But one day a big crime is committed and the only man is "Tony", the cop who does most of the "by-the-books".
T-Rex: (That's the cast-iron "thanks for the anvil" line!)

Utahraptor: What if the film isn't about Tony?
T-Rex: Man!  All I've really got to do is make that a "by-the-books" cop.

T-Rex: Impossible!  I need to find a "how-to-play" video game where Tony can't go through all the rules and rules are not only true, but REALCREDIBLE.
Utahraptor: Wait!  I've played Star Wars!  How do you know?
T-Rex: You're brilliant, Utahraptor.

Utahraptor: I've played dozens of Star Wars games.  How do you know?
T-Rex: You are brilliant, both in terms of the storytelling and the storytelling MIGHTIEST THINGS.
