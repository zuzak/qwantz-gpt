T-Rex: I have a friend...

T-Rex: A friend who I love dearly.

T-Rex: A friend who for some reason - who I don't know - has become a bitter, sometimes jealous old man.
T-Rex: Not me! Not LAZY DUDES. That is a problem I am insolent enough to own.

Utahraptor: No you are not!
T-Rex: Not me!

T-Rex: You have a problem.  A problem that I can't solve with my fists.
Utahraptor: I have solved it! You can't solve other problems.
T-Rex: I resolve my problem.  You can't solve my problem.  I BUY T-REX TIME.

Narrator: T-REX AND UTAHRAPTOR SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT BELIEVED SUCH A PROBLEM ISELF A PROBLEM
T-Rex: It's a big problem, isn't it?!
T-Rex: (Even if you were perfect!)
