Narrator: FOUR YEARS AGO:
T-Rex: Today, I have completed my first essay!
T-Rex: I am a well-educated, confident man!

T-Rex: However, upon considering the advantages and risks of my views, I have concluded that the superiority of feeling over matter is due to its density!
Dromiceiomimus: This seems pretty clear!
T-Rex: Thanks, Dromiceiomimus.

Utahraptor: So what happens next?
T-Rex: My essay may be a little self-congratulatory!

Utahraptor: But it's more than two years from now, right?
T-Rex: It's also just a year from now, right?
Utahraptor: Yeah, but it's not exactly a new date!

Narrator: ONE YEAR LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Is it terrible, or very nice?
T-Rex: Neither one!
T-Rex: It's totally terrible!
