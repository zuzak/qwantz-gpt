T-Rex: I have the ultimate CONVERSATION FILLER. Now no longer will there be awkward pauses in my conversations! Oh yes. No longer.

T-Rex: Because whenever I don't know what to say, I'll just exclaim "Sounds like a good date!"

T-Rex: An example! Dromiceiomimus - can you describe your ideal waterslide for me?
Dromiceiomimus: Um, sure! It's long, I guess, with lots of twists and turns, and some parts are dark so I'm probably a little tired out. And you got on your nerves, Dromiceiomimus!
T-Rex: I 'M just getting to that part!

Utahraptor: So what's your ideal waterslide, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Hooray! A watery hug!

T-Rex: Okay, suppose instead of saying "I'm into hugs", we'd say "Here's one: a wet, skydiving-ready hunk with a hole for us to sleep on."
Utahraptor: I find it more appropriate that way.
T-Rex: I know!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYONE IS A T-REX HUH PERSON:
T-Rex: Hunk, name's Dromiceiomimus! I know you love her name, but you need to relish the "why"?
Dromiceiomimus: Okay, "Because she's a water-themed flying dinosaur that we can ride on top of cars we bought?"
T-Rex: SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD DATE!
