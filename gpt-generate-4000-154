T-Rex: In English, we can't talk about an event without revealing when it took place! When I say "Bro, I ate all the eggs," I'm talking about feeding the chickens, and the geese!

T-Rex: They're coming for me!

T-Rex: But this is no time for tears. An egg farm is just a donation roadie! Nothing more needs to be done. An egg factory is just another front in the war on Christmas!
Dromiceiomimus: I've got one!
T-Rex: So- no chickens, no no!

Utahraptor: My plan is to simply give every single chicken in the world access to an egg, and then say how happy all of us are that every one of them is FREE toil away on an egg farm.

Utahraptor: And then, just like the old days, tell everyone that all of Christmas is now remembered for the theft of state and local tax dollars!
T-Rex: Aww. That IS some improvement.

Narrator: THAT EVENING...
T-Rex: ATTENTION, ANYONE WHO HAS ANY ENTHUSIASTS:
T-Rex: I understand that you're going to have some opinions, but MAN, who's going to catch you up? I'm serious! EVOLUTION.
T-Rex: is going to LIBRARIAN.
