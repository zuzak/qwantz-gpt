T-Rex: So, SOMETIMES, archeologists have been looking for "Carnivoreium" in the deepest caves of Saturn's Cryosphere, and they HAD been waiting.

T-Rex: But now they found it!

T-Rex: The scientists thought they might be looking for a cure, but instead of finding Carnivoreium, they found nothing. Maybe this strange metal was bound to the very core of the planet, and when it fell into decay, it lost all its ability to decay and instead grew up into a monstrous metal-on-metal creature.

Utahraptor: This theory is called "gravitonium garnetio".
T-Rex: Whatever!

Utahraptor: This one's more popular than the others. It's so common that I'm surprised I'm still thinking it.
T-Rex: I know, I know! How does a world where everyone knows what the center of the universe is like get such a dumb idea?

Narrator: CONCLUSION:
T-Rex: It's crazy! Everywhere I go, different people have different ideas about what the center of the universe is.
T-Rex: And I'm not even talking about the CRAZY TRUTH!
