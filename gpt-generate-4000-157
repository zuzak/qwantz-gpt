T-Rex: MID-AFTERNOON, IN THE PAST:  a web card

T-Rex: Hey there!  You'll love to draw a web card, just like me!  With all the stuffs and stuff to do!
T-Rex: And to conclude, a web card will be sent to all those who bid on their votes!

Utahraptor: You'll also love to speculate about the contents of this card!
T-Rex: Who knows!

Utahraptor: You may well be the perfect recipient!  That's part of what makes us all so interesting.  Give us a card and we'll speculate about what it could be!  We'll draw our own conclusions.
T-Rex:well, okay!  That's all I'm going to say.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Whatever, man!  Something had better be running!
T-Rex: THIS.
T-Rex: BOX.
T-Rex: THAT'S THE BOX THAT'S ACTUALLY ACTUALLY BEING RUNNING ALL DAY LONG.
