T-Rex: Who here wants to watch me eat a sandwich?
God: WHO HERE WANT TO EAT A SANDWICH?

T-Rex: Wow, that's super weird!

T-Rex: If only there were some way we could come up with a way to get a friend to do that for me.
Dromiceiomimus: How so?  Alright, how do you want to pay me?
T-Rex: Easy!
Dromiceiomimus: Evergreen food that you love

T-Rex: I love evergreen food that I think is at least as good as the description of the food itself?
T-Rex: I love the description of the food!  My favourite is the treat of tasting fruits and vegetables and having a full sammich of animal flesh?

Utahraptor: Wait - I want vegetables?
T-Rex: Oh God, vegetables! What?

Utahraptor: Why not combine all the above?
T-Rex: Then we're good! I love vegetables!
Utahraptor: You're not making this easy!
T-Rex: Why do I look like a stinky old bag of chips?

T-Rex: They deserve better!
