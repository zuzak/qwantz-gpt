T-Rex: I have finished a new novel! This is my best novel yet, for the simple reason that it includes one critical aspect:

T-Rex: A sex scene!

T-Rex: I find the nudity quite fetching. I am such a big lover, you know?
Dromiceiomimus: Babe! T-Rex, you're so fublar!
T-Rex: I find the sex itself to be quite fetching.
T-Rex: I find the nudity itself to be quite fetching.

Utahraptor: So you're re-writing your bestseller?
T-Rex: To steal your book, yes!  I am!

Utahraptor: T-Rex, this is murder!  You murdered my friend!
T-Rex: Then you'll believe me!  But let me pause here and say, you're re-writing your bestseller; you're specifically saying "let's murder T-Rex".
Utahraptor: I'll read it!

Narrator: LATER, T-REX LATER:
T-Rex: Damn it, you guys!  My new book is WAY better than the competition!
