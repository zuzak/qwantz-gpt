T-Rex: "The final score was [number] with a [stunning|surprising|honestly kind of expected] [upset|turnaround|nice bit of sports] in the [1st|2nd|etc] [inning|round|whatever]." I was gonna say you could write an entire book about this, but the writing's awesome."

T-Rex: "After a drawn-out debate, the audience concludes the book with the talking sports."

T-Rex: "In this comic I'll be talking to you, Dromiceiomimus."
Dromiceiomimus: You were, T-Rex!
T-Rex: "Well, of course!  Besides, it's not like we have to watch this.  It's on the big-screen."
Dromiceiomimus: "The big-screen?"
T-Rex: "It's right on the big screen, by the way."

T-Rex: "You know how it's going to be okay, Dromiceiomimus?  You've got to get over here."
Utahraptor: "I've got to."

Utahraptor: You've got to.  If not, then at least get out and admire the big-screen Hulkland."
T-Rex: "HUH???  There's nothing like a little kid on the big screen!"
Utahraptor: "I can see why you'd want to do that."
T-Rex: "I knew it!"
Narrator: WHY NOT DO IT.

Narrator: "You know how it would be okay if one of us kept playing sports, T-Rex?"
T-Rex: "I can't wait."
Narrator: THE END.
