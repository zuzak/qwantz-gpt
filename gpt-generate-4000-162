T-Rex: I have the greatest idea for a movie!  If it can do it, it must be awesome!  What must be the odds??

Narrator: BEST ENTERTAINMENT COMICS
Narrator: BEST ENTERTAINMENT COMICS WITH SIX OR MORE FILM TITLES

T-Rex: Okay!  If it can't, I'll just make up some new movies!  Like 800 or 1,000.
Dromiceiomimus: So the odds of a good movie are really about 10?
T-Rex: And then I'll just go into each and every one of them and say, "Here's the odds: maybe I'm the greatest adult ever!"

Utahraptor: Have those odds been created yet?
T-Rex: I haven't!  They're totally the dreams of millions of adult movie fans who I just met, totally!!

T-Rex: Every movie is like Romeo and Juliet, except there's no more Juliet and Romeo has to be Romeo for every movie.  There's one at the end that's entirely Exotic, but There's Also Romeo For Every Other Movie.
Utahraptor: That one's true!
T-Rex: I know!  I hit the jackpot!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE FUTURE:
T-Rex: Why don't you make up some new movies, Dromiceiomimus?
Utahraptor: I'll give them to you as a gift!
T-Rex: That's a terrible idea!  You want something new?  Just curious!
