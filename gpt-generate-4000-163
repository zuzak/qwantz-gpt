T-Rex: Have you ever noticed that summer is when pretty much everyone gets naked?

T-Rex: I have never had the TIME.

T-Rex: It's like they say: you can never get enough of "The Sexy Dresses"!

T-Rex: They also like you to wear "solES" and "Stitch Mark 4" and then draw a picture of your naked belly and sweet hot nudes on a chalkboard. Then they put the picture on a big sign that says "You'll LOVE Me, No Cheerless!"
Dromiceiomimus: I -
T-Rex: I'll sell myself short!

Utahraptor: But you'd really want to have your "ready made" pie pre-packaged into a custom made pie pre-packaged into a custom made baked uniform.
T-Rex: No! I want my custom pie pre-packaged into a customized baked uniform for no real reason!

T-Rex: They're called "Stitches" and they're pretty badass.
Utahraptor: I'd like my custom pie pre-packaged into a uniform with a picture of a satisfied cake wife on top.
T-Rex: I actually don't know if I can do that.
Utahraptor: I think you might have to bring your own eggs.

T-Rex: Ow!!
T-Rex: That one's weak but I've already drawn the conclusion that I'm good at sketching things up and they'll be ready for even though they'll probably never be able to POSSIBLY do any useful work.  Go ahead, come up with me.
T-Rex: What is Stitching Together??
