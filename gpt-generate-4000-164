T-Rex: Oh my goodness I just figured out what I was meant to do with my life. I have no plans for now. I was just going to DIE.

T-Rex: My great great great parents will probably like what I've done with my life, but I have no plans for now!

T-Rex: Alright, I will say this: my parents are going to heaven.
T-Rex: God damn it!

T-Rex: They're the sort of people who bring kids to die in front of their parents!
Utahraptor: Why do you think they're so great?

T-Rex: Yeah, I mean, I don't know - they're all pretty great.
Utahraptor: How come you're comparing your parents to a primitive cyborg?
T-Rex: I'm not!

T-Rex: I never had a desire to do that, and aggressive reaction, basically. I just want to say this: my parents are objectively great.
