T-Rex: You know those guys who have been hiccuping for 70 years or whatever? I'm glad I'm not one of those guys!

T-Rex: The guy who has never had a startle!

T-Rex: And the same goes for people who do that, but they have trouble transmission. And I'm glad I'm not the one in the problem who has been hiccuping for 70 years. STAY HYDRATED RATES, guys!!
T-Rex: ...is the thing.

Utahraptor: I think you're having a problem of your own making, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I know that's not a compliment!

T-Rex: I just feel like I haven't complimented anyone in my entire life!
Utahraptor: Man, I hear that!  You're a legend.  You have a TON in common with everyone else!  And if that isn't standing up?  I don't know what's!
Utahraptor: I'll be the first to say it.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Today I learned why we measure lifetimes in years and not in "failed trips to the moon".
T-Rex: It's this "failed trip to the moon" thing that bothers me!
