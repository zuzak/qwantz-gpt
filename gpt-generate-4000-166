T-Rex: "My ultimate baby", by me, T-Rex.
T-Rex: *ahem*

T-Rex: My ultimate baby is kinda tiny, you guys!

T-Rex: It's always been, and always will be, MY ultimate baby, even though I make it look so tiny and cute and super horny every night. Sometimes it just doesn't take an optional, "I wonder if I'll ever wonder why everything is the way it is", to get me going.
T-Rex: On the other hand, every time I think about it I feel a profound sense of personal loss, a loss of identity, a loss of joy and hope.

Utahraptor: You think about it all the time?
T-Rex: A huge "forfeit" of my dreams and innermost thoughts?

Utahraptor: Yeah, but I do it all the time: on the computer, on the cell phone, on the goddamned tractor... IN SPACE. It's just - I don't really have the means to be inconspicuous with them, you know?
T-Rex: I do it all the time on my cell phone, on the coffee table, AND on and on.

Narrator: MEANWHILE IN SPACE!
T-Rex: Where's the line?
