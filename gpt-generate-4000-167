T-Rex: I have finished a new novel! This is my best novel yet, for the simple reason that it includes one critical aspect:

T-Rex: A sex scene!

Dromiceiomimus: You wrote a sex scene?
T-Rex: Yep! It's HOT, if I do say so myself!
Dromiceiomimus: But what if someone you know reads it? What if your MOM reads it?
T-Rex: Shit! I hadn't thought of that!

T-Rex: Damn damn damn! What am I going to do? I'm doomed!
Utahraptor: Well, has the book been published?

T-Rex: Not as such.
Utahraptor: So? Problem solved!
T-Rex: I - I guess so!

Narrator: BUT TWO MONTHS LATER, THE BOOK IS PUBLISHED...
T-Rex: I'm sabotaging my own life!!
