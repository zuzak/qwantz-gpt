T-Rex: You know what they say: you can't take it with you!  You can't really take it with you!  But you can take it with you, and it's not hard!  You don't have any personal issues and are happy with how things are going.  You're happy for your partner, for how you're happy for having a new baby!  You're happy for your whole world, your whole world of shared potential.  WELL, maybe your whole world can be found in the land of Contractions.  World-eating bacteria.  World-POWdice?  World-Shinging?

T-Rex: My boyfriend and I are going to try to figure this out!

T-Rex:  You know who here is going to want to have a relationship with? Women!
T-Rex: GAY TIPS.
T-Rex: Because clearly, if I want to have a relationship with a woman, I have to first find a partner!  And that's usually a guy!  I've had good women, but they've all been harrassment partners!  I don't want to be the boyfriend of a woman who sucks at video games.  I don't.

Utahraptor: So you're dressing up as a woman to impress a woman: That's classy, T-Rex!
T-Rex: No, that's not what I meant.

T-Rex: I don't fetishize the woman who dresses up as a man and does the manliest thing and then says, "Oh yeah? Well check it out: 'twixt my bangs."  Man!  I've fetishized the whole thing.
Utahraptor: I do!
T-Rex: Do you want to be a stand-up comedian, or to demonstrate that you're a classy dude?

T-Rex: Dude, I came up with it last night!
