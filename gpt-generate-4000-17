T-Rex: If you like it when I'm wrong, then get ready to be SERIOUSLY SAD for the rest of your friggin' life!!
God: THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE

T-Rex: Guess what, T-Rex?  You're going to be SAD for the rest of your life??

Narrator: T-REX AND HIS FRIGGIN' LIFE
T-Rex: Well, that's not a problem.  Alright, fine.  We'll get some chicken wings.
Dromiceiomimus: Okay.  What about hamburgers?
T-Rex: They're my new culinary fantasy!

T-Rex: I'll make a great holiday for people who don't even like chicken!
Utahraptor: Okay.  What about dogs?
T-Rex: DOGS.

T-Rex: I like them because they're so fun to feed and prune.  They can be spayed or neuter, depending on which part of the world you look up "Vitamin B"!  And, um -
Utahraptor: Yep!  Sometimes I've seen one heck of a dog eating a bag of chips.
T-Rex: He's doing it on purpose!  I'm not telling.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: "We are all one in the same, binding biological and cultural bond"
