T-Rex: I am a guy who is really afraid of going crazy. I don't want to go crazy, okay guys??

T-Rex: OKAY.

T-Rex: And I think I've figured it out!
T-Rex: For me, there's this phrase I've developed called " Introverts "!
T-Rex: It's not so much a name for my innermost fears as a quality of my that I befriends and respects! Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: That's not necessarily a good thing, T-Rex!

T-Rex: Well, I'd say maybe it is! It's more like an accreditation agency for introverts!
Utahraptor: And then you go on to say that you've turned to "Social Skills "?

T-Rex: "Social Skills"?
Utahraptor: Yes! So hey! You're a social skills dude.
T-Rex: Oh man, I'm just a wee wee time!
Utahraptor: Oh man! I'm a social skills dude!!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: Social Skills Dude!!

T-Rex: Man, what's the deal?
