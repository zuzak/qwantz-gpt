Narrator: COMICS THAT END IN "OH SHIIII-"
T-Rex: Wow! The plants are nice and the animals are friendly.
God: SO MANY ARE THAT

Narrator: EPILOGUE:
T-Rex: What a lovely day to sit and gaze into the face of the MILLER, an ageless, unknowable part of the universe...
Utahraptor: An ageless, unknowable part of the universe??
T-Rex: Dude, who wants to hear vegetables?
Utahraptor: Not my plants! Not the least bit.

Narrator: THAT EVENING:
T-Rex: Man, if I were some stranger, I'd give him a firm handshake and say "Welcome to my farm".
God: MAN
God: PROBABLY TIMES
