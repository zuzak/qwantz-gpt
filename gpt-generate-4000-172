Narrator: TIPS FOR JOB HUNTERS
T-Rex: Attention, people who are hunting you!  You are going to say all you want to when I call you is a soft, chewy "smells" of "smells"!

T-Rex: That is.  Okay, so maybe it's smells.

T-Rex: There are ways to prevent that.  But I'll give you a hint: there's no reason to BE sad.  If you were going to tell me how bad it was, I could take it back out with me in a heartbeat.  We can all agree that it was a good day for a joke, and I apologize for the misleading title.
T-Rex: I AM SORRY.  I AM SORRY.

Utahraptor: How are you going to prove that I didn't say "smells" with my sigh?
T-Rex: Man, you don't even know my story!  Maybe this will be your last!

T-Rex: And when I call you on it, you'll say "Dear voice of reason, this case goes to the next level."  Wow!  You're the personification of such things!  You forgive me and I feel free to say "smells" or "we watch this".
Utahraptor: I guess!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: There!  My case for every reason imaginable!
T-Rex: (You chuckle)  (You chuckle)  (You chuckle)
