T-Rex: What would eclipse day be like, God?
God: GREETINGS T-REX
T-Rex: And you decide you'd rather be a sunflower next to a laziest, most uncompli-cating of the universe's pastimes.

T-Rex: You answer, and then you ran out of ideas!

T-Rex: So here's what you wanted to say to your friend, God: "Gentlemen, I am a sunflower."
God: SO YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE BUTT N' ROSES OF TOMORROW
T-Rex: Huh! What does that say about you?
God: THAT SAYS IT WEIRD, MAN
T-Rex: What does that say?
God: THAT SAYS IT

T-Rex: Now all the women want me to say is "I love you, God"
Utahraptor: I love you, God!

T-Rex: Hah! God, who is going to answer my question?
Utahraptor: Sure!  I too love you!
T-Rex: Hah!
T-Rex: Forget I said that!  I could ask you some questions, and I WILL say "Hey, God!  This apple is a real good tree!"
Utahraptor: Sure.  I'll!

God: T-REX IS THIS SOME-THING I LIKED COMPUTER-STUFFING THINGS TO DO LAST NIGHT
T-Rex: I just found out!
God: I WAS SURPRISED BY THE FOOD YOU SAW ON THE BEACH
T-Rex: I guess this summer went way awry!!
God: SO YOU WANT TO GO ON A BUG SAMMICH
God: THIS BELLY BEATS OUT
