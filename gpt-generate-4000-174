Narrator: HILARIOUS DIFFERENCES IN RELATIONSHIP
Narrator: a comic
T-Rex: Once upon a time there was a man who would sit with his friends and read some comic!

T-Rex: It was a great deal of work for a guy who just happened to be single!

T-Rex: So the friend sat down and said "Hey baby, do you have any comic issues? I've put together a simple and straightforward solution: weyllabs! I'll give you a break from friendship and instead of high fiving up on someone, do you check your phone or wallet?".
T-Rex: "You can't!"

Utahraptor: And he did!
T-Rex: And then he FRIED back out.
Utahraptor: Exactly!

T-Rex: And then he became very angry and became very angry and when he said "You fives, I will fives" the guy was already getting extremely angry!
Utahraptor: Exactly!
T-Rex: And then he started getting kinda sad and we were sitting there and he heard about friendship and we said "What's it all about? You know, I hope it was some other guy's friendly way of getting things."

T-Rex: And he felt like, well, that's what friendship does, right?
T-Rex: It opened up whole new avenues in that regard!
