T-Rex: I have the best joke for Dromiceiomimus. If you were worried that I'd never be friends with you because I'm not a date, what if you were worried that I'd never be friends with you because I'm not as good as I thought?
Dromiceiomimus: Well, not necessarily! I've got a lot of cool friends!
T-Rex: True!

Utahraptor: If you were worried that I'd never be friends with you because I'm not as good as I thought, what if you were worried that I might never be friends with you because I'm not as good as I seemed?

Utahraptor: Well, you're a friend who has challenges, right?
T-Rex: Challenges for SEX??
Utahraptor: Challenges for REALITY, baby!

God: T-REX HAVE YOU EVER REALIZED YOU CAN EXPLAIN ALL the words in the Greek word for "vegetarian" (axiomimus).
T-Rex: Then I feel bad about saying that!!
God: OKAY SO SURPRISE YOU ARE ACHIEVING YOUR HIGH SCHOOL ACTING MIND FOR MY BATHROOM
God: WITH BETTER ADVERTISING PROMISE EACH OTHER
