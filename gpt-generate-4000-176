T-Rex: I wonder if there would ever be a nation in the future that described itself in opposition to other nations!

Narrator: Happy Canada Day Comics: Yes!

T-Rex: I hope in the future not so much that we define Canada as "Oh, so sleepy, eh?"
Dromiceiomimus: How do you think it'd go?
T-Rex: I don't see how! I'd just end up being a snooze really easyway way for Canada to slip up!

Utahraptor: How do you see a future where we define "Ahhhh, the Canadian Way"?
T-Rex: Canada in the '50s, says!

Utahraptor: And then other nations started recording national information, and Canada was like - oh, this even applies to the future!
T-Rex: TRUE. But then other nations started programming satellites so they could do things that the Canadians couldn't, and then the CRA was started, and the other nations start spying on each other and we get Canada's Fair Use Act information laws.

T-Rex: Then other nations start dressing up as us and launching satellites at us over our heads!
Utahraptor: Oh man!
T-Rex: THEN, HANDY MANNEQUINS ARE GOVERN TO BE THE PRODUCT OF THREE POEMS OF CONFLICT.
Utahraptor: That's not bad, I guess!
