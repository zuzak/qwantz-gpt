T-Rex: I have received complaints. Apparently I can be difficult to follow, and sometimes people get confused.
T-Rex: I would like to change that!

T-Rex: I will help you find a news portal that is more like it!

T-Rex: You will have to register to our local website to gain access to our most popular news.
T-Rex: However, you will be able to find our articles, images and videos on our personal device!
T-Rex: Your online identity will be protected by copyright law.

Utahraptor: Your new identity will be protected by copyright law only if you buy a book with your copyright statement in it!
T-Rex: That's not a big thing!

Utahraptor: Yeah, but it is a big thing. "Your identity" is pretty important to me. I thought we agreed?
T-Rex: Wow! copyright law is a tough plan!

Utahraptor: We'll be the first to say: no!"
T-Rex: But there's no time for that now!
Utahraptor: We'll just have to agree to it, and then we'll have to take the next step and totally forget about copyright law!
T-Rex: *gasp*
