T-Rex: Today is a good day I think to talk about phlogiston!

T-Rex: Who uses phlogiston?
T-Rex: It is the first idea that came out of science!  It's so crazy!

T-Rex: Phlogiston was a really good idea because if you eat a lot, your heart rate goes up!  heart rate, in fact, is an important heart rate thing.  So to speak!  So if you ate a lot, your heart rate would go up!  It was a great idea!  But then phlogiston went out of fashion!  Nobody was bothered by it anymore and there's basically no reason to use it now!

Utahraptor: Phlogiston was actually a really bad idea for a lot of reasons!
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yeah, but you couldn't really use it because you didn't know what you were talking about!  You were really early on, just spitting out all the phlogiston bits, and already you were worried you'd get smeared all over your house.  Besides, you're talking about a perfectly good idea?
T-Rex: Yep!  I know!  I just stepped on one, and it was very nice.  I might have to go sell some.

Narrator: A FEW DAYS LATER, T-REX MEETS A ZOMBIE DINOSAUR:
T-Rex: Hello, my name is T-Rex and I'm a tiny dinosaur from Japan!  I tried to eat one, but my fork got in my way and I ended up stompering a babe and the rest is history!
Japan: T-Rex, what's the news?
T-Rex: Nothing!  I left lots of room for character development!
