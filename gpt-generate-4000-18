T-Rex: Oh crap! Everybody died!
T-Rex: I'm the last one left on the planet!

Narrator: THREE DAYS LATER:
T-Rex: Oh crap!
T-Rex: I've totally died... of something... personal!

Utahraptor: It sounded like you were going to tell everyone you've killed that you died of something different, but then you came out saying you died of something totally different: something you call "the temporal lobe disease of which there's only one known cure".

T-Rex: "T-Rex died from the idea."
Utahraptor: What!
Utahraptor: I was going to say your name. "I was going to say your name, and everyone agreed I was the one who died."
T-Rex: "It was the most awesome death!" said Utahraptor.

Utahraptor: There's no way I'm ever going to argue about you that way.
T-Rex: I'm not!
Utahraptor: No, I'M just going to make you look bad, and then not take anything back, and then you'll never visit me in my stead ever again.

T-Rex: *sigh*
