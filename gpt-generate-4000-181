T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!

T-Rex: I will consider it as a public service!

T-Rex: To begin: your house is mown and you live in it!
T-Rex: My friends, this is not a very good day for looking after another!

Dromiceiomimus: You're squabbling with your tiny neighbour over a fork in the road!
T-Rex: No!
Dromiceiomimus: Yes you're squabbling with there over the fork!

T-Rex: What a woman!
Utahraptor: Well hello, T-Rex!

T-Rex: I'm quite pleased with my own appearance today!
Utahraptor: I thank God for that!

T-Rex: I envy your refinement!
