T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! Oh MAN.  I'll never get to do an eight-issue limited series.

T-Rex: All I have to do is figure out how to raise the issue of racism in the audience, and nothing will bother me!

T-Rex: Hey, you know what's bothering me?  Not over-emphasizing the problem of racism, but also over-emphasizing the power of sexism.  I'll never be racist towards you in the novel I write, okay?  I will love you and we will laugh forever.  I did these things on purpose.  I certainly did them to see to it that nobody we know thinks we�� ANYMORE LIKE RACISM.

Utahraptor: Are you sure?  Maybe I'd have more of that in mind when you get home?
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: All I really wanted to do was figure out how to make you feel better, okay?  Maybe if I stood there for a long moment, we could have a sexual encounter.  We could have a sexual encounter over drinks of water.  I don't know.
Utahraptor: Then I guess we can just forget about us.]

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE SOMEONE HAS ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED THIS AMAZING SENTENCE:
T-Rex: I got opinions!
