T-Rex: Who here wants to watch me eat a sandwich?
God: WHO HERE WANT TO WATCH ME HEAR ME OUT FOOD AND SUCK THE GUM

T-Rex: OMG, does eating a sandwich scare you?

God: IF YOU REALIZE NOW
T-Rex: If you sandwich me, I will come out and say "Wow, you really enjoyed eating a sandwich", and then I will come out and say "Wow, that's disgusting, I hate it" and then I'll come out and say "I didn't enjoy eating a sandwich back in the day!"
God: OKAY STOMPING ME THROUGH YOUR SHENANOR OF VACATION
T-Rex: Wow! That's disgusting!

God: DOES IT STOP MY VACATING YOUR BODY WHEN I RESTORE IT
T-Rex: Sure do, God!!
Utahraptor: NO IT DOES NOT

Utahraptor: IT ACTUALLY STARTSles you the first time you touch a food, not a second later!
T-Rex: OH MY GOD. That's disgusting! God is going to do something to me that makes me think about my passive aggressive ways of life!
Utahraptor: Oh god, I think about it all the time!
T-Rex: Okay, I'll handle this. I'm going to lay out a plan around the issues I have.

Narrator: MANY YEARS LATER:
T-Rex: I have been practicing child welfare, and it has been a fiasco!
God: NO CLASSIC IMAGINATION T-REX ASK ME IF YOU WOULD BE HONEST I'M A REALIST
T-Rex: What is child welfare?
God: SHOULD YOU BE HONEST I HAVE A PARENT
T-Rex: Nevermind!
