T-Rex: Dudes! Is it finally time to get serious about sex?

Narrator: TIME IS RUNNING FOR YOUR HEAD SUCKS!
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!

T-Rex: Who here wants to get serious about sex?
Dromiceiomimus: ...Yes?
T-Rex: I, um, I think it's time for me to get out and meet some really great people!

Utahraptor: You're dating a guy, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Whoah!

T-Rex: God damn it, this is first thing I see when seeing a T-Rex onscreen character.  He has that big rugged mane and alluring luscious brown hair.  Then you think to yourself, "Wow, wow!  That T-Rex has the perfect woman."
Utahraptor: Are you looking to have polyamorous friends soon?

T-Rex: Polyamorous loves include, but are not limited to, relationships (polygamy), friendships (your friends and family), and relationships in which partners are present (your partner and friends).
Utahraptor: That's a reference to friend group "polyamory".
T-Rex: Yes.  The focus is on that now.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Man, who's the good guy in my story?  Me!  On the other hand, I've got friends!
T-Rex: Good thing you got the friendliest friends!
