T-Rex: Hey, English! Why you gotta be so sexist?

Narrator: WHY YOU GOTTA BE SO SEXIST, ENGLISH

T-Rex: Why you gotta have a word like "old maid", chock full of negative connotations for unmarried adult women, but there's no equivalently-negative term for unmarried adult men?
Dromiceiomimus: And don't forget "spinster"!
T-Rex: Holy crap ENGLISH! Why didn't you say "spinster" or "spinster-eyed widow" or "spinster-eyed widow"?

Utahraptor: "spinster"?
T-Rex: IMAGINE IT SUDDENLY.

Utahraptor: Now you're saying women should have the same rights as men, huh?
T-Rex: Now I'M SAYING WOMEN'S TASTE.
Utahraptor: Um, no.
T-Rex: Now I'M SAYING ISMENCE.

Narrator: LATER: ENGLISH:
T-Rex: Excuse me for sexism, English!
Enthusiastic man slaps his friend, enigmah:
T-Rex: Female equivalent of "you may'"
T-Rex: Oh my God!
T-Rex: I'm literally the greatest!
