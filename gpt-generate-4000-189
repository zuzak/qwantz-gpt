T-Rex: Dang girl, you know I wanna kiss you baby!

T-Rex: Girl you know if I get your consent I'm gonna press my lips up against the nice parts of your head!

T-Rex: Damn girl, I think I just bit my tongue! Yeah, I got that guy good, babe. I bit right into the prehensile mean that lives inside my face but you know as soon as blood stops pouring out of it I'm going to slip that flattened fleshy tube right inside your mouth.
T-Rex: You know I'ma position the moist entrance to my digestive tract up against yours.

T-Rex: Girl, is there a piece missing? It hurts a lot.
Utahraptor: Girl, use your fingers to probe my mouth real quick.

T-Rex: Girl I gotta step to the hospital, but you know when I get out I'ma kiss your oral cavity. I'm gonna moisten my lips with liquid excreted by specialized internal glads, and I'll press those excretion covered lips all up against you.
Utahraptor: Damn girl, you know I use my tongue to spread that saliva around.

T-Rex: Girl the blood keeps coming out, can you call me at least?
T-Rex: Girl I gotta run to the hospital, but I think I got out of here pretty easily.
