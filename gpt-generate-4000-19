T-Rex: What did the depressed snowman say to his dog? "It's a useless dog!"

T-Rex: "I'm not useful!"

Dromiceiomimus: But he said it was useless.  So what'd he do? He went to the ER.
T-Rex: He called the ER.
Dromiceiomimus: Then he addressed the dog.  The dog knew a lot about English, but this guy from eighty years ago was from 80 years already.  This is what he said, in the past.

T-Rex: The ER doctor said "It's a good thing that your symptoms are no longer a surprise, and that you are, in fact, actually alive."
Utahraptor: What are you talking about?

T-Rex: The idea of a dead person who's been dead for too long is ridiculous.  I've been thinking of all these things and not a moment has a pass.
Utahraptor: Man, you've had too much!
T-Rex: A moment? The end!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Fifteen dollars, a plastic surgery bill, a copy of Plato's "Ethicdrove By Plato" which I gave to the ER doctor, three times over, just to make him stop what was going on.
The Devil: PROCEED
T-Rex: Well, those are all hypothetical situations, and I'm still not comfortable with them.  Fifteen dollars, a plastic surgery bill, a copy of Plato's "Ethicdrove BY Plato" which I gave to the ER doctor, three times over, just to make him stop what was going on.
The Devil: PROCEED
