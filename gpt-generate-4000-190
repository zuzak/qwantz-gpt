T-Rex: We can only imagine what it must have been like - and it's much worse now! - when we lived in the past.

T-Rex: It was rough, everyone there!

T-Rex: And it's worse now, when we let memories of childhood pass us by. It's still rough, but we let it pass. We let it pass with every passing day.
Dromiceiomimus: You're describing past generations! You're implying we'll pass into the future.
T-Rex: The future without us! No generation without us!

Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex, what's the future like?
T-Rex: It's good!

Utahraptor: Hey, me too, T-Rex.
T-Rex: A future without us? A time when we erased memories and lived side-by-side together, even though we didn't know each other?
Utahraptor: Not good. I think they've all managed to beat us.

T-Rex: A beautiful woman, with golden hair, stood before me, a pure, beautiful white colour in the eye.
T-Rex: Oh my god, my vision in the future
