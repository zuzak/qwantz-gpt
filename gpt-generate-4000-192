T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! Oh MAN.  I'll never say this time.

T-Rex: This is the worst time of my life.

Dromiceiomimus: I know!  But I still think you should do this!
T-Rex: Why?  Because it sounds awesome?
Dromiceiomimus: because it sounds like a song I just read?
T-Rex: BECAUSE I'M SORRY FEAR OF BEING BORED If I Had A Better Idea, I would WRITE IT.

Utahraptor: I'm not sure what you're trying to say, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: No!  It's not my idea.  I'm just tired of hearing it.
T-Rex: I will not be forgotten!
Utahraptor: We have to get outside your friggin' skin!

Narrator: SHORTLY...
T-Rex: Awww, man!  That was indeed an excellent idea!
T-Rex: To the hospital, Utahraptor!
