T-Rex: Okay, so APPARENTLY a singular, gender-neutral "they" has a long and proud history.

T-Rex: APPARENTLY, even Willy T. Shakespeare himself used "they" this way!

T-Rex: And APPARENTLY, I'm not unarguably in the right when I say that "they" is always plural. Pluralization is SO STRESSFUL that even bad ideas can still be used against us, even if those unpopular ideas are now relatively safe because they apply only to us. That's pluralism!

Utahraptor: I think you're forgetting something T-Rex!
T-Rex: HELL YEAH!

Utahraptor: How can pluralism be reduced to, oh, one word spells "they" and we're stuck with the same thing?
T-Rex: oh, one word spells "I declare the English language to be an open, verifiable and facts-based superhighway", and we're STILL not extending "I" beyond "I've seen/done/sees/seen/me." Huh.

T-Rex: Hey, I actually meant "to convey a thought, idea, idea..." instead of "to mean" or "to give feedback", which I guess would've been a lot more satisfying.
T-Rex: Also, I meant "to be communicated by mouth, not through mouth".
T-Rex: Also I meant "to be communicated by T-Rex, not through Rex".
