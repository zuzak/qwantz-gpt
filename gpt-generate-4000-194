T-Rex: Suddenly I feel as if my future is full of new choices, new directions!

T-Rex: My choices are mine to decide!

T-Rex: But yet, I feel troubled. If I make some change in my life, what of those I leave behind?
T-Rex: I am happy here, but I know I won't be happy if I stay here forever. Leaving becomes a bitter-sweet necessity.

Utahraptor: You're leaving, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I see it!

Utahraptor: Since you entered this world, I've come to accept that there is no such thing as a fully realized self.
T-Rex: No, those who wreck upon the physical plane cannot truly be friends.

T-Rex: indeed, for I have found in this joy of discovery the Woman Who Never Stopped Saying Something That Someone Else Else Else Was Talking To Me About It!
T-Rex: Daaaang!!
