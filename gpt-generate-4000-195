T-Rex: I've decided that despite the commercialism of the season, I will still be giving out presents to all my friends!

T-Rex: However, I will achieve this by sneaking into their houses and leaving the presents there!

Narrator: SHORTLY:
Dromiceiomimus: Hey, T-Rex! My house is slightly modified from the one you found during our recent break! What's the deal with it?
T-Rex: The deal is that it's a Dromiceiomimus home!
Dromiceiomimus: Oh man! How are things?
T-Rex: I'm really sorry, but I can't.

Utahraptor: It's closed 24 hours a day for routine repairs.
T-Rex: Hah!

Utahraptor: The problem remains! There's always a chance a closet sock could be found there.
T-Rex: Even if I find a one-way ticket, all is not lost! I will still offer up my house for strangers to find.
Utahraptor: There's still a chance they'll come over for more.

Narrator: SUDDENLY!
T-Rex: What's up?
