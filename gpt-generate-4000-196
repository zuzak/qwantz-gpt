T-Rex: I have kissed two ladies.

T-Rex: And I'm so tired of them!

T-Rex: I keep wondering if there is any truth to my words, but if no, I'm going home and basking in the satisfaction of kissing the ladies.
Dromiceiomimus: You've kissed like you're alone and sincerely enjoying the attention, T-Rex!
T-Rex: That, Dromiceiomimus, is a REAL JOKE. I'm going to go home and kiss both of them.

Utahraptor: That's fanciful! How did you know?
T-Rex: What did I say?

Utahraptor: I kissed both of my girlfriends.  Yes!
Utahraptor: They're pretty good.

T-Rex: So are you going to kiss later tonight or the next morning?
Utahraptor: The next morning?  The next morning?
T-Rex: No, I'm going to kiss them at my convenience.
T-Rex: What are you talking about?
