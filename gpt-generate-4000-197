T-Rex: You guys! I just wrote the best will. It's the best will!

God: DOES IT HAVE NIGHTS IN A HAUNTED HOUSE
T-Rex: It DOES!

T-Rex: And that's just where it starts. After my would-be heirs spend the night in the haunted house, which is clearly specified in my will to be ACTUALLY HAVING LARGE WEAKNESS, I'll say " perchance to see, do, and say ". And then they'll sigh and get really crazy and make jokes about HOW EVERYONE'S HAVING LIES.
Dromiceiomimus: Only in the bathroom.
T-Rex: But in the bathroom else people are having sex! And it's weird! Some of us find it really embarrassing when we don't go to the bathroom together.

Utahraptor: You're basically assuming everyone's had sex before, right?
T-Rex: Right!

T-Rex: But, on the plus side, it makes the sex more exciting, because if you forget it, you have no idea who's having it, who's making it, who's hit or miss! And it gives the heirs of the trait a chance to show that they're not the victims of their original birthright parents!
Utahraptor: Hilarious!

T-Rex: It's a great way to end the second of my letters: "stunned", I know, but I wanted to write about my new sexualities ending nightmare!
Utahraptor: Sex!
T-Rex: It's a great way to end the second of my letters: "stunned", I know, but I wanted to write about my new sexualities ending nightmare!

T-Rex: Oh, wow!
T-Rex: It's something I haven't considered!  Before I wrote "unreliable" and "absurd"!
Utahraptor: That was an extremely funny joke!
T-Rex: It's true!  I had to laugh out loud because, as a joke, there's a joke I'm not joking about.  This is all part of the joke I'm making.
