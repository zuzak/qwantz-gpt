Narrator: HOW TO USE LINKEDIN
T-Rex: LinkedIn is a social network for if you think your job is the most important thing about you! It's full of nerds bragging about what stuff their cool profiles got when they "bit" their friend T-Rex!

T-Rex: So here's how you get started on LinkedIn!

T-Rex: Now, I've never used it because I'm not a turbonerd, but I'm pretty sure I know how you should run your own account.
Dromiceiomimus: I use Chai.co because it's like - what do you want with someone who follows you on Twitter?
T-Rex: Yeah! I know what you're thinking: ACHIEVEMENT.

Utahraptor: What's up with that - you don't like turkeys?
T-Rex: And what's up with turkeys that haven't eaten since I set up shop 18 years ago?
Utahraptor: That's what I'm thinking about one!

Narrator: BUT SECRETLY:
T-Rex: LinkedIn doesn't have a "follow me on" button, it has an "edit permission denied" button. So I ask you to click that, but it won't take effect until I edit your bio and remove the "Always correct!" text.
Utahraptor: Awwww.
T-Rex: A new one is just whipping out photos and posting them on social media! I'll prove it!

Narrator: BUT SECRETLY...
T-Rex: LinkedIn doesn't have a "download limit" button! It has a "NOT BRINGING TO BE" button.
T-Rex: Looks like y'all gonna go down in history though!
