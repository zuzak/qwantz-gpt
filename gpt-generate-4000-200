Narrator: DINOSAUR COMICS ASKS: IF YOU COULD LOSE ANY SENSE, WHAT WOULD IT BE?
T-Rex: Me sense of proprioception!

T-Rex: That's the sense that lets you know where your body parts are at any given time!

T-Rex: And it's EVEN MORE sense-increasing sense, Dromiceiomimus: a sense of proprioception.
Dromiceiomimus: And it tells you where your limbs are if they're near where you're falling!
T-Rex: Yes! You are now literally looking down, where you might hit a falling object.

Utahraptor: Are you seriously trying to lose proprioception?
T-Rex: Why yes, absolutely!

Utahraptor: I think you could still do a lot with proprioception. For example, if you had failed in your job just because you had a low threshold of proprioception, that could allow you to run in places you aren't normally tired from.
T-Rex: That is what I'm saying! I'm saying you're out!

T-Rex: I've entered a deep pessimism about the future! If we can ever find a Rory who is just okay, we've never met.
Utahraptor: I've entered a deep pessimism about the future, T-Rex! You've bribed your way up from the bottom of a flooded drain!

T-Rex: You winks, then, at the side of the people who got fired from being in charge. "You got fired!" they said. "That guy has WAY too much SHIT!!"
Utahraptor: I don't understand how you can say that.
T-Rex: You do?
