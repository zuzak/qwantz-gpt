T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, party at my place tonight!

T-Rex: Am I the only one in like university here?!

T-Rex: I never thought I'd say this, but tonight I'm going to bed early. I'm going to bed early, because the door is right here!
Dromiceiomimus: Wake up T-Rex! I woke up earlier!
T-Rex: W-What?

T-Rex: I just realized that I can order some food and get out of bed early. You hear that? And I hear that? And I decide that if I want to wake up early, I should get in bed.
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex! You heard that? And I hear that? And I think to myself, "DICK N' SNACKPIES, I need to go nap early."

T-Rex: Another night of "no mess'n quick" and "how can I get out of bed early?" and "is this truly dog day?"
Utahraptor: Sounds like a great idea!

T-Rex: I know, right? I was like, "omg, time to get out of bed early! I need to go nap early."
Utahraptor: Great! And?
T-Rex: And? and then? and then I told him I was going to "dress really well" and "enhance my appearance."
Utahraptor: He said, "No problem!"
T-Rex: Hah hah! I totally looked like a dog in my amazing "disease" t-shirt!

T-Rex: I believe him! I believe him right?
T-Rex: It wasn't an attractive idea, it was too awesome!
