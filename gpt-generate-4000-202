T-Rex: I have a great idea for a comic that'll please everyone, even... THE DEVIL.  For every comic I print out, there exists another that I'll print out and send to the entire world!  FOR EXAMPLE: if you know how to make a bomb, you could print out a copy of the bomb, and make a few.  Then, you could go visit some places and get the hell out of town!

T-Rex: And this makes me the perfect guy to print out and send to the entire world!  THE I AM THE T-REX PUPPIE.

Utahraptor: So you intend to put out any number of comics, even ones that don't mention your name!
T-Rex: Even better: I intend to put out a "mummy pudgy piddle" called "The Leprechaun's Oral Bible"!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!
T-Rex: The Deinococcus radiodurans pudgy piddle is really the best example of this.  In fact, all you need to do is double-check your facts and you can make an entire life choice say "Bible" with you!  That's brilliant!
Utahraptor: Hey, I should print out and put "mummy pudgy piddle" in it!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Utahraptor, the big law was actually an all-caps version of "The Curse of Paedamuses"!
Utahraptor: Huh!  I imagine that'd taste a little like food.
T-Rex: You know what?  I think it's pretty easy to make a living off my awesome pun.
