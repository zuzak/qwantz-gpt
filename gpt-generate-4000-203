T-Rex: What if I made a list of all the things that made us happy?

T-Rex: Hello?  From now on, I am going to count happiness as the number of times I have wished that!

T-Rex: So happiness is the equal of sadness and joy!  DEMAND I BE HAPPY, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe!  I don't know about you, but I respect how you value happiness.
T-Rex: Really?  Great!  I like your smile.

Utahraptor: So be happy!
T-Rex: What?  I'm happy!

T-Rex: Haha, you say that!  I was just wondering if it's happy to be happy, and I like the way you're talking.
Utahraptor: Are you sure?  It's pretty happy.
T-Rex: I am!  I like your smile!

Narrator: BUT, SECONDS BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE IS HAPPY:
T-Rex: I really want to go out and get happy!
T-Rex: So?
