T-Rex: I don't want to brag but I'm REALLY GOOD at relationships.  All my sweeties have said so!
T-Rex: Before we broke up, I mean!!

Narrator: T-REX FIXES THE RELATIONSHIPS

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, tell me about your relationship problems.
Dromiceiomimus: Okay, well, there's this guy at work who I'm pretty sure thinks that I'm a pussy, and I'm not, um, sure whether I'm a pussy or not.  I jerk off.  I yell compliments on the side!
T-Rex: But it doesn't work!

Utahraptor: What if I jerk off?  What if I do what you want to do?
T-Rex: Nothing!  Like, what if I jerk off and get married?

Utahraptor: Man, say what you're going to say, because it's MOST likely what you're going to do.
T-Rex: "I'm gonna jerk off and get married.  What are you going to say, Utahraptor?"
Utahraptor: "I'm not even certain I'm a proportional polyamorous relationship!"

T-Rex: Polyamory! It's the idea that says we don't need to friends and have awesome friends to have awesome relationships.  It's awesome.  You hear it a lot and you're like, "What?  What friend?  What feedback have I got?'
Utahraptor: 'No way, that would be so awesome.'
T-Rex: 'That sounds awesome, but I'm on it, sorry.'

Utahraptor: The key to happiness, my friend, is this: listen to your heart.  When you hear someone's heartbeat, try to help them through their feelings, but don't always!
T-Rex: Okay, but can we help them through feelings?  That's a non-canon market!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Okay, good! My heartbeat is okay!
Utahraptor: It's okay!
T-Rex: You know what?
T-Rex: I think it's pretty okay.
