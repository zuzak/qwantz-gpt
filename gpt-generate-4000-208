T-Rex: You know what I'm most impressed by when people say I have a great work ethic?

T-Rex: People who say they have amazing work ethic!

T-Rex: And even though I sometimes express disappointment at not a perfectly constructed plan B, I still know that I'll be remembered for the work done. Unhindered, I make work of my imperfections and try to get even better ones done!
Dromiceiomimus: What are you doing with your imperfection-free time?
T-Rex: I'm doing work that's gonna take me on farms!

Utahraptor: Are you concerned that if people saw your skill, they'd say "Ah, that's ILLEGAL"?
T-Rex: Because I am!

T-Rex: I'm worried that if I'm the world's #1 antivenomist, I'll become known as the WORLD'S ANTIDONIST, after being the object of my dislike.
Utahraptor: That's not what I meant!
T-Rex: The point is, you can't make work if you'rethe world's greatest expat. You'renot supposed to make world-class work if you'rethe world's second-greatest expat.

Narrator: T-REX IS ON THE COMPETITION ENGINES!
T-Rex: That explains why I can't say anything!
T-Rex: Now, if you'll excuse me, I'M going to heck and building...
T-Rex: ... and then the world stops talking and I was going to say I'm not the world's greatest antivenomist.
