Narrator: COMICS THAT END With "And then the music stopped, and we never met again!  All that remains is the terrible pun we had last night!"

T-Rex: Whoah, everyone!  This is me, eating a sammich with my hands!

T-Rex: And this is everyone else, sitting around, idly, alone, chilling in a boat!  Suddenly, a hurricane of a-card recognition opens the door to our little boat party, and we know it.
Dromiceiomimus: So this is how come we never meet again?
T-Rex: NO, not again! This is one of the MANY MANY FAIRY reasons we never meet again!

Utahraptor: And if there's someone without a father figure, that's not a very good match?
T-Rex: Exactly! And if there's someone without spouses or children on the way, that's even worse.

T-Rex: LICENSINGLY AWFUL, in that order!  LICENSINGLY LICENSINGLY.
Utahraptor: Oh god.  Listen, I think you should know I've got a new sense of humor!
T-Rex: Oh god.

T-Rex: LICENSINGLY UNFORTUNATELY LICENSINGLY, in that order!
Off-panel: T-Rex, you've got a second chance!  The chance of someone meeting you at a party or a bookstore.
T-Rex: DANG, Y'ALL.
T-Rex: I'M STILL NOT SURE IF YOU'RE AT LEAST COMPETING THOUGH
