T-Rex: What should I do if I see someone littering? Every time I do something different and every time I think differently.
T-Rex: I know these are smart decisions, but they make different decisions. These are my two biggest fears.

T-Rex: ONE: NOBODY WILL THINK I'D LITERALLY DO THESE THINGS
T-Rex: AND TWO: IT'S ACTUALLY DIFFICULT

T-Rex: People might think you're a monster and not appreciative of your crappy clothes. That's what we all must have to go through here, huh?
Utahraptor: But how do you know which people are appreciative of people?

T-Rex: I can't! I've had people emailing and responding and say "Dear T-Rex, never have I looked at your clothes so irritated. I wear this because it's on account of the fact that I carry a little body, and also because I'm a thief. And also because I hang out in the nude. Anyway all I want is a hat, which you wore today. I wear this because I found out you're willing to do the things I want."

Utahraptor: I think that's gross!
T-Rex: I do wear this because I found out I'm a dick!

T-Rex: It's not meant to be laughed at.
Utahraptor: Man, what are you doing?
T-Rex: For laughter?
Utahraptor: For being a dick?

T-Rex: Don't do it, Utahraptor! Begging is the second-most-common form of laughter, after chuckles.
Utahraptor: Huh. I just thought you'd be able to use it like that, and remember: it's the most common form of laughter.
