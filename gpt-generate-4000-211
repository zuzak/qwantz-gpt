T-Rex: I have the ultimate CONVERSATION FILLER. Now no longer will there be awkward pauses in my conversations! Oh yes. No longer.

T-Rex: Because whenever I don't know what to say, I'll just exclaim "Sounds like a good date!"

T-Rex: An example! Dromiceiomimus - can you describe your ideal waterslide for me?
Dromiceiomimus: Um, sure! It's long, I guess, with lots of twists and turns, and some parts are dark so it's scarier, and everyone's screaming! Oh, and at the end, we all accidentally get chlorinated water in our eyes.
T-Rex: SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD DATE, my friend!!

Utahraptor: What? That wasn't even your example!
T-Rex: UTAHRAPTOR! What are you doing here?

Utahraptor: I WAS WALKING BY AND COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING. You're all "here's an example of an awkward pause!" but then set her up to say exactly what you want! Also it didn't even work, because nobody wants chlorinated water in their eyes on a date.
T-Rex: We'll see about THAT!

Narrator: T-REX CALLS HIS MOM ON SPEAKERPHONE:
T-Rex: Hey mom, if you went out on a date with someone, would you want them to splash chlorinated water in your eyes?
T-Rex's Mom: No, honey.
T-Rex: Aw MOM!
T-Rex: Did you not see that splash?
