T-Rex: I have discovered the ultimate secret to comedy! The more obscure a joke is, the less people there are who'll get it, but the MORE they'll find it correspondingly HILARIOUS! I suspect this law progresses geometrically.

T-Rex: For example!

T-Rex: Let's say I have a joke about how cats like to sleep. NOT FUNNY, right Dromiceiomimus? Everyone who's met a sleepy ol' cat can get that. But if I have a joke about how, say, an obscure programming language is pretty wacky, then people who know that language will feel like I'm talking to them! They laugh both at my joke AND in recognition. Comedy increases, and the only reasonable conclusion is "laughs ahoy!"

T-Rex: So logically, ALL I HAVE TO DO is find a really rich guy and tell him a joke only HE'D find funny, and I'm set for life!
Utahraptor: Huh?

T-Rex: Dude, rich people LOVE to give people money when they make them laugh! And I'm going to track down Patrick Stewart and make him laugh SO HARD. You don't even know.
Utahraptor: Patrick Stewart? Is he really that loaded that he gives money away for funny jokes?
T-Rex: Um, HE COMMANDED THE ENTERPRISE?
