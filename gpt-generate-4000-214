Narrator: a comic for heterosxUAL WOMEN

T-Rex: heterosexual men! Here is a simple and TRULY effective way to become MANLY.

T-Rex: by going to the supermarket!
T-Rex: AND if you're not manly, you can't go to the stake meal, can't you?
T-Rex: HOLY CRAP. YOU HAVE BEEN WONDERED WHAT HAPPENED.

Utahraptor: Wow, that's a HETORIOUS WOMENENT.
T-Rex: I know! I THINK it's pretty amazing.

T-Rex: Go to the grocery store and buy some NON-MANLY foods. There, to the chagrin of the men, I Passively Completes the Nitty-gritty of the Men Who Never Tried.
Utahraptor: Wait! I'm doing it again! This time, I Passively Completes the Nitty-gritty of the Men Who Never Tried.

T-Rex: Utahraptor, you're doing it again! This time, Keep Up The Attempts To Punctuate My Naked Gaze.
Utahraptor: I AM. I stand corrected.
T-Rex: MY QUESTION is, why did you forward it to me?
Utahraptor [offscreen]: T-Rex, it's me.  "Who?"
T-Rex: It's no longer a t-shirt.  "I am the person you are today."
Utahraptor [offscreen]: What?
Utahraptor [offscreen]: T-Rex, you don't look erection-hungry.  I just see me excitedly reading the Afterword and deducing their meaning.  I just stare at the naked parts of our bodies.  I call my deduction "The deduced" and it is now Perfectly Pleased.  We have nothing more to worry about then.  Okay!

T-Rex: I'm - I'm actually totally excited too!  I just laid waste to a department store to a skyscraper and now we're all "Oh.  I Want to Scroll Through Years Of History Figures Who Have Been Tweeting About The Dangers Of Eating Dinosaur-Assy Stuff."
T-Rex: "I"LL READ YOUR LOGIC
Narrator: "I"LL REALLY WANT TO READ THESE SO MANY YEARS FROM NOW
