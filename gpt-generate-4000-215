T-Rex: I have been compiling a list that I think might be of value!
God: WHAT'S THE HECK POINT OF THIS
T-Rex: Ten thousand words, God!

T-Rex: What God, I mean.
God: IT'S STILL A RESEARCHING GENRE
T-Rex: ...Okay, I've got some friends at this party.
God: MAN ON BACK SPACES
T-Rex: What?

God: I'M NOT A PARTY PLEASE
T-Rex: Okay, thanks!
God: MAN I'M NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN MY ELECTRIC SCIENTIST BECAUSE OF THE PILLOW
God: YEAH I'M NOT GONNA HELP BUT YOU
T-Rex: Man, whatever!

T-Rex: I'll be honest: it's a really hard pick.
Utahraptor: What's the consensus of the last bunch of experiments?

T-Rex: Two things: electricity and entropy. Two pickles in a glass of water? That's total friggin' entropy.
Utahraptor: I don't think that's the case.
T-Rex: I don't think that's the case! I do not!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE BERNOONE:
T-Rex: Man, what if the experiments we did on bacteria were totally great, but then each Nobel winner got to read their names on the cover??
T-Rex: Also how are we gonna get O'Keefe's degree when he's back from the planet?
