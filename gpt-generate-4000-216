Narrator: THINGS TO SAY WHEN SOMEONE HAS BROKEN UP WITH YOU
T-Rex: Sometimes, someone will break up with you. Aw snaps! What do you say to THAT?

T-Rex: Here are some things you can say to that!

T-Rex: "It's okay, sweetie! I'm sure one day you'll find someone ALMOST as good as me!"
T-Rex: "Would you also break up with a rocket skateboard? BECAUSE THOSE WOULD BE GREAT. LIKE ME. I AM GREAT."
Dromiceiomimus: "You can't fire me, baby! I quit!"
Utahraptor: "Don't you think you should have settled while you were ahead?"

T-Rex: "No. No, babe, I got like two chicks."
Utahraptor: "What if one of us is a cat??"

T-Rex: "No, that's not important."
Utahraptor: "Would you also break up? NO."
T-Rex: "Because I'm gonna break up with you."
Utahraptor: "Because i'm gonna break up with you."

T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: "Because a rocket skateboard is just too damn sweet for my taste."
T-Rex: *sigh*
