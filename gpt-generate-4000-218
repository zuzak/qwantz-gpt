T-Rex: Any machine that travels through time has to be a machine that travels through space as well! I've got to be the first to say this!

T-Rex: This will be a problem of the LIFETIME PRACTICE!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, do you know what an early Universe that was, that was, a.k.a. Jutland was? A.K.a. Australasia? You could have spent your life living here, and still have spent your life being excellent auteurs. I don't see any reason why you shouldn't go over and explore this question.
Dromiceiomimus: I did not, T-Rex.
T-Rex: I do?

T-Rex: Utahraptor, you've conspicuously avoided this subject. He really is a jerk, eh?
Utahraptor: Yep! But we're hardly ever told that you're a "pathologic pathologist", T-Rex.
T-Rex: Well, I do if I want to talk about pathologists.

Utahraptor: Okay, fine, I - you've got a good run, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Good!
T-Rex: See?
T-Rex: Holy crap yes!
