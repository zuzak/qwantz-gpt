T-Rex: What if you wrote a story about modern technology arriving BEFORE it did in our timeline? You'd have computers made out of brass and steam! That sounds like it might be...AWESOME?

God: THAT GENRE IS CALLED STEAMPUNK T-REX
T-Rex: What? I didn't write "modern technology" down just now!

God: MOST OF ITS MASS AND SPEED ACTUALLY GOES AFTER THE BOWL OF A CHIP PUNCHES ANTARCTIC
T-Rex: What?! God says choppy bowls of music are better than boring bodies of water! What does HE mean by "modern technology"??

T-Rex: Well, what he saying is "early warning satellites" it's more than "head tracking particle satellites", Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: I thought you were the one saying "head tracking particle satellites"?

T-Rex: Aw, that's cool I got you!

Utahraptor: I doodle sometimes and it kinda takes off my essays, actually
