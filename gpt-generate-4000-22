Narrator: HOW TO USE WIKIPEDIA
T-Rex: Wikipedia is amazing if you want to know facts about something, but INSTEAD decide to go with what a bunch of internet strangers have temporarily agreed is the truth!!

T-Rex: Actually, it's kinda ideal for that exact situation!

T-Rex: And if you don't like what Wikipedia has to say, you can change it! But then some random stranger will change it back with a verifiably hilarious sentence or phrase, and you'll have used it too! And then you can start saying it AGAIN, and all you've do is STILL happen to agree it's the truth!
Dromiceiomimus: So?
T-Rex: It's a perfect solution!

Utahraptor: Wait, why's that?
T-Rex: Because it's hilarious?!

Utahraptor: Yeah, but all you've really done is link to a site that admits you're wrong, but also leaves out the fact you're wrong too: you're looking for "NOT POO".
T-Rex: Exactly! I find that disgusting, but allowed it. Wikipedia's a Lolita - I'm a right wingery!

Narrator: LATER: RIGHT LIGHT ALLOWED TERROR TO COMPRESS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE TO AVERAGE VISTAMOTORIES
T-Rex: Oh yeah, right!  The world is ready for Leftist Zombie Cartoonism!!
T-Rex: So You Think It's Not Cool To Talk About Reality!
