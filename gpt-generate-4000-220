T-Rex: I have, like, powers! Like, powers!

T-Rex: Okay, so!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I want you to come with me to the party where we drink brandy. It's a great party, Dromiceiomimus. We'll have delicious brandy. And candied apples. And ginger ale.
Dromiceiomimus: You know, ginger ale isn't really a drink at all.
T-Rex: It's just - a ginger ale is like - a ginger ale with a twist, a li'l.

Utahraptor: I think it's pretty clear that this is a fun party, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It is!

Utahraptor: It is, you know, most of the fun times we've had today.
T-Rex: (Laugh) It is.
Utahraptor: It is!

Narrator: BUT, SECRETLY, AFTER ABOUT 30 BUCKETS WE BORROW.
T-Rex: *gasp*
T-Rex: *gasp*
T-Rex: *gasp*
T-Rex: *gaaaaaaaaaaaasp*
