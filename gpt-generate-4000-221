T-Rex: Guess who had a bike accident yesterday morning! If you didn't, then I'm sorry!

T-Rex: But then I had a FAKE bike accident!

T-Rex: And the bike was WAY WONDERFUL!
Dromiceiomimus: And now you're not going to get any better bikes, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Well - and here's the thing - I had a FAKE bike accident too!

Utahraptor: How do you know? You were not healthy enough to get a bike?
T-Rex: That's what I'm saying!

T-Rex: You could say I got your attention!
Utahraptor: The fact that you don't get a bike is a good sign.
T-Rex: That's exactly what I'm saying!

Narrator: THAT EVENING...
T-Rex: So if I'm your father, do you want me to identify as gay?
