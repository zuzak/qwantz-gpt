T-Rex: I have begun to receive insulting phone calls!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: "Call me dumb! Phrases like 'two ape-man are dead' are all part of yesterday's Pantheism!!"

T-Rex: It's a big 'e' there, baby!

T-Rex: You're just trying to one-taptize me, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: No, I don't think that's what Pantheism is.
T-Rex: ... Okay, that's cool, that's cool. I'm cool. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with that.

Utahraptor: Hey, is your call "Coolhand" or is it "Coolest Handsworth"?
T-Rex: AHHHH!

Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: OH MAN, MY GOD, THAT'S PRETTY WEIRD! I love that that was the first thing I said to you!
T-Rex: It's really weird, you know?

Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: Coolest Handsworth, that's cool too!
T-Rex: Hah, no, actually I was talking about my other hand, and the worst part is that this is the ONLY TIME she gets mad!
T-Rex: Also, I took out the garbage and now i'm pissed because i didn't want to give it a second chance!
