Narrator: DINOSAUR COMICS
T-Rex: Dinosaurs were giant ferocious lizards!

T-Rex: These were the sort of animals that built... The umbent... The Great Gatsby.

T-Rex: And from prehistoric times on, they'd sported a pair of silk-toothed toes...that were shared by a later, more sphenological origin!
Utahraptor: Which!

T-Rex: Unfortunately, these amazing creatures of the past didn't evolve from prehistory. They're current, and rightfully so, as we share more of our cultural and historical roots with them.
Utahraptor: But I guess we'll do the same with non-elders of God?

God: T-REX GIVES YOU A DESiccated Lion-Head-T-Rex: I've Idea What.
God: I GUESS THAT'S A Long Road
