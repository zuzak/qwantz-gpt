T-Rex: Guess who had their first dream of flying last night?

T-Rex: Gentlemen, ladies: calm down please!  It was me!!

Dromiceiomimus: You sure feel like you flew a zeppelin over Europe a couple of weeks ago, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I feel WAY better now!

T-Rex: If only we had a little sex!  WE WON'T TAKE NOTHING BACK, EXCEPT... bugs!  Bugs would be home with us!
Utahraptor: Bugger!

Utahraptor: You're a hairy guy, right?  We'd love to see how it goes!
T-Rex: Oh, sorry, I forgot how you never say "true to size" before you fly over Europe and nobody likes you anymore.
Utahraptor: That's okay, T-Rex!  You got it!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: I'm a nice lady with a nice bone, don't you think?
