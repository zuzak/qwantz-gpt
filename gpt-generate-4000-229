Narrator: ASK PROFESSOR SCIENCE
T-Rex: Our first letter comes from "Chuggy G", who writes -
T-Rex: Hey, it's Chuggy G!!

T-Rex: We used to date!

T-Rex: Anyway, Chuggy G says "Dear Professor Science: why can't we get all our meals in pill form?". One time Chuggy G and I went to a pond to feed the ducks; she loved doing things like that. When we got there, all the ducks were gone. I don't remember what we did after that.
T-Rex: Isn't that weird? I haven't thought about that day for years.

Utahraptor: We can't eat only pills because they don't contain the calories we need!
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: Calories come from fats, proteins, carbs and boozes, and none of them compress very well. Plus eating is a primal pleasure that I'm sure many would miss. I wonder what Chuggy G is doing right now.
Utahraptor: Plus pills don't recreate texture.
T-Rex: She always said she'd make it big.

Narrator: LATER, AT PROFESSOR SCIENCE'S HOUSE!
T-Rex: Professor Science! Can you introduce me to your friend, Professor Why Am I Suddenly So Nostalgic For Someone I Haven't Thought About In Years??
T-Rex: It's definitely possible to get a PhD in that, yes?
