T-Rex: Oh crap oh crap...
God: WHAT
T-Rex: I Had A Totally Nice Trip

T-Rex: to Disney World
Utahraptor: Why did you go?
T-Rex: I was just wondering if it was the best way to go out of your weekend!

T-Rex: To check on the horses, that's been done! Wouldn't you say it's been great?
Utahraptor: I guess! The whole "going to Disney" idea, you know? The whole idea is that you get to see the magic of the world while also having a fun time at the park.
Utahraptor: That sounds like a good idea!

Narrator: BACK AT HOME...
T-Rex: That's what that feels like!
