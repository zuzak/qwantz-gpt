Narrator: THE SONG DAY 1:
T-Rex: Huh, I heard that song just now!

Narrator: DAY 23:
T-Rex: IT IS THE SAME SONG AGAIN!
Dromiceiomimus: Hey T-Rex, what's the favourite SAME SONG?
T-Rex: Huh!  It's the same song, only I've never heard it!

Utahraptor: What's the favourite SAME song?
T-Rex: Huh!  It's the same theme, only it's so overdone and the chorus is so lame!

Utahraptor: What's the favourite SAME song without being derivative?  Like with Rapper Star and Counting Crows!  There's no shame conveyed!
T-Rex: No shame, Utahraptor!!

T-Rex: "Somewhere over the Rainbow", you mean.  "Someone's S A R A C E Sume".
Utahraptor: Ah, that's the classic "Someone's R A C E Sume Together".
T-Rex: No, that's the favourite "Rapper Star".
Utahraptor: I like it.  I don't get itetime.

T-Rex: "My body is so sexy and makes out with my butt in a hot puddle", said Robyn.  I will never get tired of that!!
Offscreen: Hah hah hah!
T-Rex: I love that you love "Someone's S A R A C E Sume"
T-Rex: No man I love that!!
