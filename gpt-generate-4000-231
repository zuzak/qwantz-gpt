T-Rex: Hey, English! Why you gotta be so sexist?

T-Rex: Why you gotta BE so BIASED?

T-Rex: What not to love: just be themselves! For example, beautiful, interesting, unique, interesting people who I thought I knew well helped me in some way or another. People in real life! That's what I think!
Dromiceiomimus: That's not attractive!
T-Rex: Exactly! I think it's either that or having romantic issues, and then having no feelings at all. I don't know!

Utahraptor: Well, we're having feelings here, T-Rex! You don't have any feelings.
T-Rex: Exactly! I find it pretty amazing that you're this sexist thing alone!

T-Rex: How did you know? Well, I just realized: I've never had a consistent, consistent set of feelings.
Utahraptor: Huh.
T-Rex: Well! I guess I'll find out if I really do enjoy being a sexist dude through experiment and error.

Narrator: THAT EVENING...
T-Rex: I just realized I've never had a consistent, consistent set of feelings
