T-Rex: I have a great idea for a story, and it involves you!  Oh man! What if one day a new dude wanted to write a story?

T-Rex: Then it would be HILARIOUS if this dude just stopped working for an hour and said "I've got a problem."

T-Rex: That's a good story, but do you want to do it?  I've got a story for you!
Dromiceiomimus: I can do one story, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Sure! I'll be the kind of dude who just lets you tell stories.
Dromiceiomimus: I'll do the other story, T-Rex.  What?  No, I want my story to be a positive one.

Utahraptor: I think it's time for us to start thinking about WHOA BILLION OF DOLLARS!
T-Rex: That's okay!  We're awesome!

T-Rex: We have more than enough debt to live comfortably.  We need a superhero that will take the burden off our shoulders.
Utahraptor: I really don't see how that's possible.  Besides, if we have this much debt, why can't we take care of our problems without?

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE FUTURE!
T-Rex: Oui oui tout le monde - et ca n' arret pas!
T-Rex: Je veux une petite quelque chose quelque chose!
