T-Rex: I have been compiling a list that I think might be of value!
God: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EVERYTHING I KNOW NOT TO KNOW

T-Rex: What?

God: FINE
T-Rex: The thing is, I don't really know any useful knowledge about anything.  How am I supposed to know anything, knowing only the chemicals in food that can induce death?
God: T-REX
T-Rex: What????

Utahraptor: You're saying you don't know anything!
T-Rex: Yeah, but I'm saying you should give me a break!  There are so many foods with chlorophyll in it!

Utahraptor: Yeah, but how am I supposed to know if a food is good, just by looking at it?
T-Rex: Well!

T-Rex: Said question is now answered!
Utahraptor: All I'm saying is that I'll be creative!  I'm going to gather disparate foods, bestow gifts on the World, and use deduction to determine if a given object is good, just because it's so familiar.

Narrator: AT THE WEDDING:
T-Rex: Hey, liveScience!
