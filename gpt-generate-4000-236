T-Rex: I have thought of the perfect prank to play on the Utahraptor! I will confide in him personal stories about my youth...

T-Rex: ... stories that, it turns out, are false!

T-Rex: That way, years down the road if he ever chances to mention one of these stories, I will be able to say, "Got you!"
T-Rex: He'll say, "What?", obviously confused since my prank was years in the making.  But once i explain that I was in fact LYING to him when he though he had my number, he will laugh heartily and concede that I did indeed "get him"!

Utahraptor: Hi, T-Rex!  Do you have any personal stories of your youth you'd like to confide in me?
T-Rex: I do!

Utahraptor: These stories wouldn't happen to be FAKE stories, would they?
T-Rex: um
Utahraptor: T-Rex! Were you going to tell me fake stories?
Utahraptor: You were!

T-Rex: Hoisted by my own petard!
