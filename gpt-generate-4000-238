T-Rex: Hey God, would the world be an even awesomer place if everyone named "Benjamin" and "Walter" were named after people named after dead people?
God: HONESTLY
T-Rex: I named "Benjamin" and "Walter" bc that's what names themselves feel like!!

T-Rex: And HE chose "Jungle Mouse" because he really liked the name and ALSO because he thought the name was EASY to remember!
God: MANY DREAMS LATER
T-Rex: Hah man!  This dude just got "Jungle Mouse" which I feel is best pronounced as i speak and pronounced as i say, and also, "mouse".

Utahraptor: HONESTLY.
T-Rex: HOWEVER, MY thoughts and opinions ARE GENEROUS.  Utahraptor, despite what websites say, my speech is exactly the same!

Utahraptor: I think names are Feasible!  I think names convey GUILT.  I think names spice things up, and oxygen is a Must.  I also think names spice things up the worst.
T-Rex: Utahraptor, you're so blind!  Your eyesight is totally compromised, and so are you unable to see and care for them?  Your entire life will be spent hearing these awful names, and no matter what you do, I can guarantee you

Narrator: HAPPINESS IS A SUBLOATORY COMPROMISE
T-Rex: I have performed this extremely job
Narrator: ON THINGS GOING AS WE SAY "WHAT CAN I SAY?", and forecast and imagination go wild
