T-Rex: I have the greatest idea for a movie!  I've said this before but this time it's for serious.

T-Rex: There's this cop, right?

T-Rex: And he's a "by-the-books" guy with a reputation for being unreliable.  So basically, every movie he makes is made by the same guy, and even if he's starring in a few, a lot of people will say he's not that reliable.  What's not to like?
Dromiceiomimus: Sooner or there's directors who make more mistakes than author-blaming Nobel prizes!
T-Rex: (That's the classic "Benjamins And Abelard Ligands" example!)

Utahraptor: What movies would be for real movies this weekend?
T-Rex: This weekend!  The INTERNET.

T-Rex: This weekend, Utahraptor, is where THIS movie is headed.  Will it end up being a total flop?  Or will it get noticed as one of the best Oscar wins ever?
Utahraptor: It would be great.  I'm serious!  It would be great.  It would be one of the best Don Walsh movies.

Narrator: DON WALTERman, THE DON TIMES
T-Rex: It is a watch I made that was SO AWESOME!
T-Rex: I made it so dark that the candles would burn, the tiles on my stairs would crack, and my grandmother's shoe store would fall over.
T-Rex: Great!  Wow.  That's a lot of movies.
