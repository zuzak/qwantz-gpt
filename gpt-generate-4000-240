T-Rex: Hey God, would the world be an even awesomer place if every decision, every thought, every thought... could be objectively wrong?
God: SURE
God: I GUESS

T-Rex: Then we'd have free-floating doors, nobody gets killed and the world is awesome again!

T-Rex: OBVIOUSLY.
Dromiceiomimus: I think people would agree that your choices are awesome too, T-Rex.
T-Rex: I know, right? We could make your life be the story of how you'd get to live a super life, but then we could choose to imagine you running around with that empty cup, saying "Perfect!", and hanging around, and maybe a message for us on Twitter that says "Hey, we deserve a tweet instead. Thanks for being awesome."

Utahraptor: I think your life is awesome, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Okay, some of it is!!

Utahraptor: I think it's nice that you think being awesome is so nice, but I think it's also OBVIOUSLY unfair.
T-Rex: Hey, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: What's your favourite colour?
T-Rex: Hah hah, Utahraptor!  My favourite colour is like, a red/black combo?

God: T-REX I WAS RED
T-Rex: And then I was like, "I'm not even sure what a kaleidoscope is"
God: "And then I recalled"
T-Rex: "And then I remembered THAT WAS THE NIGHT I WAS BORN"
