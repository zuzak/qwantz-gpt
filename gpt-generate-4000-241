T-Rex: Oh crap, looks like you dropped out of an ELEPHANT OF WORDS RELATIONSHIP! OH CRAP, I'M GONNA LEARN MORE

T-Rex: Drake is no longer with us in real life! Oh crap!!

T-Rex: I dropped out of an ELEPHANT of WORDS and am now personally invested in the future!
Dromiceiomimus: Why, why did you do that?
T-Rex: I just realized I haven't had - or will have not had - any education since I was seven!
T-Rex: A lifetime of accumulated knowledge that no longer serves any useful purpose!

Utahraptor: Why Drake, I don't understand! You're so lost in thoughtlessness.
T-Rex: I don't know, but at some point you got lost in thought.

T-Rex: Once I realized that, I could not be more inured to the aesthetics of language! I became a catatonic master of the aesthetics of glances and smudges.
Utahraptor: Too bad we've lost someone in the aesthetics of language!
T-Rex: Not if I use glances and smudges, okay?

T-Rex: I'll say this: Pants on.
T-Rex: One sec.
