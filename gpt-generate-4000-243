Narrator: COMPRESSED SONG COMICS
Narrator: "HOLLABACK GIRL"
Narrator: BY GWEN STEFANI AND PHARRELL WILLIAMS

T-Rex: Gwen Stefani is not a holla back girl!  This is her shit, and it's way more interesting than trying to pull it off.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: THIS BRAND NEW PEA YOU CAN'T EVEN EXCISE WITH YOUR FAIRY TO PUNCH THE CATTLE
Narrator: THE END

Narrator: COMPRESSED SONG COMICS
Narrator: "I CAN'T HELP MYSELF"
Narrator: BY THE FOUR TOPS

T-Rex: The narrator can't help himself and wants you to let him talk more about his feelings, but you're his friend and he's his best friend and he's his best friend and he says he wants to be your friend.  AHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  We've all been lost in our own personal fictions.  This is truth, the end!
Narrator: COMPRESSED SONG COMICS
Narrator: "I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU"
T-Rex: The narrator says he's looking for you and you go away, but then you come closer and closer, closer to tears, and he froze her window!
Dromiceiomimus: So plausible.
T-Rex: I know!  And he said "Okay, I'm sorry, I got lonely" and -
T-Rex: - she locked eyes with you??

Utahraptor: Nostalgic!  How did that happen?
T-Rex: I don't know, but it seemed like she was trying to pull a flidballsy function together.
Utahraptor: Did she use a synesthesia function?
T-Rex: Oh yeah, the same "kissing" you get when you press "M" on cue, only she's your "commendation".

Utahraptor: And you sort of wait for the kiss, only now you've kissed me earlier.  And now you're licking your lips, and I'm trying to ignore how you're moving your arms, and when you turn your head to look at me, you're looking into her eyes, and you say "M-M-M-Me".
T-Rex: I -
T-Rex: I want to kiss you again.
