T-Rex: Zombies! Everyone loves zombies. They are a window onto the Other! They let us face our fears of society in a way that is accessible and compelling, as well as accessibly and compellingly cannibalistic!

T-Rex: YES.

T-Rex: This is great news for us who are new to horror! Zombies let us experience the horror of long-term exposure to the Other without going through the hassle of setting out to become a zombie!
Dromiceiomimus: How'd they work?
T-Rex: Easy! All you have to do is supply convincing images of yourself and your friends, and the resulting images let the Reader Generated imagesenhance!

Utahraptor: Okay, let's see if we can do that with Zombie Book awards.
T-Rex: Sure! Let's do it!

T-Rex: Okay, let's use the award-winning "Interstellar is Cool Now, Wait A Few Nights" technique to award graphic novels author awards!
Utahraptor: Aha! But won't the award be on Star Trek?
T-Rex: Uh, hats?
Utahraptor: Yep!

T-Rex: That's a great idea, Utahraptor. Let's award Star Trek graphic novels their "best graphic novel" title!
Utahraptor: Okay, how about "Story in which a Brief History of Written Texts"?
T-Rex: Utahraptor! It's a great idea! Let's do it!
