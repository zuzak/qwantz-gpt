T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! Oh MAN.  I'll never say ANYTHING again.

T-Rex: I have the best idea for a series of books!

T-Rex: I have the best idea for a series of books!  And the best idea is that, if successful, all I have to do is say and do 10 secs cure cancer!
Dromiceiomimus: Well, there's your catch! If you do not make a commitment to write 10 secs, then you can't apply for a hospital emergency department, and so the hospital stays are actually waiting for you on their hands and knees.
T-Rex: I can imagine that!

Utahraptor: That IS a really good idea!
T-Rex: I know, right?

Utahraptor: I'm not sure that's the best idea ever, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I will, however, be particularly generous with the sick bastard. I will be as generous as to give every one of my friends the same benefit of my tears, as long as they're not weeping at me!'s head!
Utahraptor: That's not a problem, that's a dream!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYONE THINKS THEY CAN SLEEP IN A BOX 24 HOURS AGO:
T-Rex: Oh my gosh; it's
T-Rex: OH MY GOSH; IT'S A PRANK OF MY OWN AND HAVE I NEVER GONE ANYONE DONE COMICS
