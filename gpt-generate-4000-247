T-Rex: Back in the time of History, how on Earth did we get so good at baking delicious baked goods? Let's answer that question with an answer!

T-Rex: Baking it's own delicious, right?

T-Rex: And without even simple sugars present, we've evolved to bake things with huge expectations, prepping the food we eat for baking. And without even simple hydrogen and oxygen molecules present, we're never even told how to cook it! We're taught how to use just a little of each, and even then, there's no way we'll be able to tell when someone's baked a delicious baked good.

Utahraptor: That's one person keeping the whole thing, not me!
T-Rex: I get it! Bake me some delicious bread, and I'll have a friend bake it for me.

Utahraptor: I see. You don't think it's a great idea?
T-Rex: I don't get it -- only with GREAT KNOWLEDGE. You know what I get for my money? One delicious loaf of bread!
Utahraptor: I don't get it either!
T-Rex: OH MY GOODNESS. I don't get it.

God: T-REX YOUR CREMATION FORBIDED ME A CREMATE CREMATE bread
