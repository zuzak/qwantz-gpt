T-Rex: I have made a very important New Year's Resolution! It's to make sure that my name becomes an EPONYMOUS ADJECTIVE.  People will soon all describe things as "T-Rexian"! What sort of things?

T-Rex: Awesome things, natch!

T-Rex: Wait, huh? I'm not the sort of person who says "natch". I never say "natch", I say "naturally" and even then only sometimes.  I have no idea why I said "natch" just now.  I'd like to take it back, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: Hah, hah, too late! Looks like being T-Rexian is using unpopular and out of favour slang for no reason!

T-Rex: Aw, shoot! My eponym is a disaster!
Utahraptor: Plus it wouldn't even get used that often!

Utahraptor: The only time I can say is right now, while everyone else is saying "ew, that's dumb" or "that's ridiculous".
T-Rex: That's too late! There's been no such instances.
Utahraptor: Then you'd better get on with your day, eh?

T-Rex: Okay! The only time I can say is that I believe you will act on this.
T-Rex: On your own!
