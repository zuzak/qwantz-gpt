T-Rex: Who here wants to watch me eat a sandwich?
God: SURE
T-Rex: Dude, it's totally easy!

T-Rex: Just do your normal motions! For example, holding to the side while holding to the door.
God: MAN THAT'S NOT REALLY HARD

T-Rex: You wouldn't do that, right? It would take practice to do that. I bet you'd use the freeform "hold" on the first try and end up with a weirdo sandwich.
Utahraptor: Sounds like you.

Narrator: NEXT TIME, ON DINOSAUR COMICS: SOME UNEXPECTED SUCCESS.
T-Rex: Man, forget that! I always wondered if there was anything wrong with me!
