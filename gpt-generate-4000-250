T-Rex: This is a SPOOKY TRICK show!  Kids, it's about...

T-Rex: ...cooking!

T-Rex: I've prepared a meal for the hungry!
Dromiceiomimus: That's your description? You totally made a meal!
T-Rex: What? No!  It's not me!
Dromiceiomimus: I've had guests prepare meals for me!
T-Rex: But you're unfamiliar with the science!

Utahraptor: Hey, do you have any guest meals planned?
T-Rex: I have but one!

T-Rex: Will you munch on a sandwich or nap on a cheeseburger?
Utahraptor: Sounds like the most delicious way to spend a Friday night!
T-Rex: No man, that's just food!
Utahraptor: How is that a bad idea? All my meals have been papered with cheeseburgers!

Utahraptor: If you want a side, come over.  I've got my own.
T-Rex: My own money!
Utahraptor: No!  Come on!  I'm just a Parka time man!
T-Rex: My own body!
