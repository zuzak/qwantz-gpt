T-Rex: Descartes is a dude who wrote everything into his name! He's not a dude to say things that are small or small.

T-Rex: Or very, VERY small.

T-Rex: He's kind of a big deal.  You look at literary giants, you're not prepared to say things like "LOL, I'm the greatest English writer of all time!", and then you think about how that would translate to English as a Moreenal-priest: "I'm the greatest person ever! I carry the Holy Ghost, and I deliver the Holy Ghost to us all. Just one: I'm the one who's the one who's the Holy Ghost."

Utahraptor: Ah, but is that a real sentence that always gets said?
T-Rex: Well, I'm experimenting with that!

Utahraptor: So let's hear what you've written down tonight! I'll say something awesome, maybe big!
T-Rex: OKAY YEAH but let's hear what we can't hear, okay? Let's hear what we can hear: "The sun will not rise any higher, for it is not at all high!"
Utahraptor: "The hour of desecration begins not at noon, but at noon!"

T-Rex: Utahraptor! We can hear you out!
Utahraptor: Hey, what's up? You always get a good say in the first sentence!
T-Rex: I'M NOT UNIQUE WHAT'S MY DEAL
