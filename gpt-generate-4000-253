Narrator: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ETHICS AND MORALS COMICS
Narrator: excuse me
T-Rex: You know what ethics are?

T-Rex: Ethics is the process by which we determine what we should do with our lives. It's called 'sight', if you will, and it's really just a collection of perceptions we've had that determine what we should do with our lives.
T-Rex: It's really interesting if anyone heard it at my expense!

Utahraptor: Whoa, not heard it at my expense!
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: Normally when I have a crisis, I look at it and say, "Wow, if only I'd spent my time having sex with myself instead!"
Utahraptor: You look a little embarrassed by your own standards, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I know! I looked at the numbers and said "I guess they don't count time in ethics because we're all busy with kids."

T-Rex: I was wrong!
T-Rex: Their eyes are designed to see sexy things.
