T-Rex: Here's something that I, T-Rex the talking dinosaur, have trouble believing in: true love!

Narrator: T-REX AND FRIENDS DISCUSS: TR? L?V

T-Rex: The problem I have is that so many people claim to have found if, but the odds that you'd ever meet that one person AND that they'd be available, willing, and of the right gender and sexual orientation are really pretty small. CONCLUSION: a lot of people must be faking it!
Dromiceiomimus: But "true love" doesn't mean that there's only one person you can have it with!
T-Rex: Debatable! People often talk about finding "the one".

Utahraptor: I think that you're being too strict about this, T-Rex!
T-Rex: How's that?

Utahraptor: You're reading it as if there's one "true" person that "true love" can refer to, meaning that you've got ONE CHANCE for total happiness in the world, and loving anyone else is just settling for second place or worse! I've always seen it as referring to, say, how a wheel can be true, when it spins perfectly and doesn't wobble.

Utahraptor: Oh, no! You're referring to, say, how I love my partner?
T-Rex: Hah!
T-Rex: Language! Basically, if you say "I love you" to someone, they will turn to you and say "I love you"!
T-Rex: It's some measure of refinement, a man must admit.
