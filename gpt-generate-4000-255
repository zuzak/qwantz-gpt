T-Rex: Who here wants to watch me eat a sandwich?
God: WHO HERE WANTED TO WATCH ME SLOW DOWN THE FAKE VASTEPT OF EARTH
T-Rex: Ok!

T-Rex: Woooo!

T-Rex: The food was pretty okay, actually! Some people wanted to eat it first, while others were worried that if I ate it I'd DIE. Some gave the sandwich to a hungry friend, while others had different theories on how it got there.
T-Rex: SOME WERE VERY SINCERELY, and some had machine-made skeletons inside.

Utahraptor: And they came up empty?
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: Some said it was the best sandwich they'd ever tasted, while a few had skeletons inside, but which still said "It's pretty okay if you eat it. Also, the skeletons will die of old age around here."
Utahraptor: That's a terrible theory, T-Rex! It's worse if you say it's a BAD theory because it's not true!
T-Rex: It's not even that bad!!

Utahraptor: Ah. So we agree on one thing, right? For instance?
T-Rex: Yes! People who have bad theories about science are DONE to SAY THEY ARE TRULY BEST.
T-Rex: Any alternative which is not entertained is extinguished by the continued need for constant affirmation
