T-Rex: It's the 50s! Sputnik has just orbited above the United States and peeps are FREAKING OUT. America wants to win the space race, and comes up with two options.

T-Rex: The first is to back down from the treaty!

T-Rex: But the SCIENCE guy thinks this is a bad idea! America's the only one who can make the space program, and if we don't have an America that can compete we'll all be dead. Also, the birds have to fly onGES. America is trading better than credit bureaus.

Dromiceiomimus: But America only offers military advice, T-Rex!
T-Rex: TRUE. But what if we instead choose to send a stargazer to scout out the skies or help a POW that's about to POWDER?
Dromiceiomimus: That's the CHOICE you made tonight! And it's a SHOT GAME.
T-Rex: Oh my god. THAT is a VIDEO GAMESGOING PUNS.

Dromiceiomimus: Man.
T-Rex: And that is a GAME, by the way.
Utahraptor: And yet, you find a way to make a game about a video game and not the other way around.

Utahraptor: And the POWs don't actually last long, if you have a crappy title.
T-Rex: Utahraptor, it's the 90s!  And this is LITERALLY THE GAME WHO WINS A PROMOTIONAL HOUR.  The end!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE REAL MIND OF TIME:
T-Rex: " 90s: A Game About 90s Games "
T-Rex: " Game Over " " Game Description " Game Description "
