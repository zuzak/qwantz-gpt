T-Rex: I just realized that no women have ever been to the moon! ONLY DUDES. DUDES WHO RETURNED AS MEN.

T-Rex: Apparently, you need a sausage to get on the moon!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I've never been to the moon!
Dromiceiomimus: Thanks, dude! If only there were some plans!
T-Rex: What? We'll never go!
Dromiceiomimus: I'd love to!

Narrator: LATER, THE MESSENGER TAKES OVER!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I've a new plan: we're gonna go to the moon!
Dromiceiomimus: Thanks, T-Rex! But I'm making this a strictly dates-focused date where you're unlikely to meet new, interesting people! NICE.

Narrator: LATER, MAN: THE PLANE IS TAKING OFF FROM THE MOON AND MAKING SPACE OVER THE POTTEN OF MY HEAD
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: I'm not - I'm not impressed!
