T-Rex: Normally people have trouble with sequels after their first idea is so, and I'll say it, so transcendentally brilliant. But not me! I have ideas for basically infinite sequels.

T-Rex: Basically infinite out-of-genre cover sequels, that is!

T-Rex: When my explosion-centric disaster movie comes out and people want more, I will say to them, "No, ACTUALLY, you want the same thing, but this time, as a gross-out comedy!"
Dromiceiomimus: So the story starts out the same, but the guy slips on some lube and then lands in an old jock strap!
T-Rex: Hah! PRECISELY. And it keeps happening throughout the film. The power goes out, and nationwide, folks slip on the lube.

Utahraptor: The next sequel could be a road trip movie!
T-Rex: EVEN BETTER.

T-Rex: Some TEENS go out on a road trip and unwittingly stay just ahead of all the destruction! You can see it in the background of some of the shots, but they never notice...because they are all too busy learning about friendship!
Utahraptor: I like it! Dozens of sequels, all revolving around the same story!

T-Rex: A western! A loner cowboy, caught between wilderness and civilization, enters the nation and tries to stop the disasters!
Utahraptor: Does he succeed?
T-Rex: No. He shoots a lot of guys while failing to stop it, though!
T-Rex: "There is a showdown between a cowboy and a volcano."
T-Rex: "Some move to cooler heads!"
