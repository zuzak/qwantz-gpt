T-Rex: Who here wants to watch me eat a sandwich?

T-Rex: Wow nobody??

T-Rex: Okay, who here wants to watch me prepare a sandwich, you guys! First off, I want to see if the chemicals in my food break down into norepinephrine, which is a toggle switch that lightsizes the rest of my nervous system!
Dromiceiomimus: What's a toggle?
T-Rex:phrine! First off, I don't know why you need recycled epoxy but I'll do more than that. I also don't want isometatic acid, which is what's left over from when your body ages and is prone to oxidation.

Utahraptor: I'm not sure you'll be able to tell by smell your sandwich is good enough.
T-Rex: Oh, just pure elk!

T-Rex: I'll use the organic matter in my digestive tract as a food source, but you know what's left? The product of thousands of years of evolution.
Utahraptor: I suppose.
T-Rex: In the case of meat, that's worth it!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE BIBLE:
T-Rex: Theophan, dude you are, did you know that existed when this planet was discovered and named "T-Rex"?
A creature of the future, I imagine!
