T-Rex: If I ever build an office building, I'll have the world's most colossal outhouse!

T-Rex: Hah hah! Looks like I powered down the internet this afternoon and just yesterday was too horny for me.

T-Rex: So, I'm not surprised when I hear that, oh I don't know... engineers are more sexual than amateur?
Dromiceiomimus: Oh, I was just hoping you'd noticed that.
T-Rex: I MADE IT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE ON THE CURRENT REACTION THERModynamics-wise-wise-I THINK- I'Ma- with- isometric contraction.

Utahraptor: That's ridiculous! Why would you make things stronger?
T-Rex: Because you want to be awesome?

Utahraptor: What? You'all weak. Even if you think you're awesome, things will make you stronger.
T-Rex: I knew it!
Utahraptor: Okay, but still. It's ridiculous.

Narrator: THAT EVENING...
T-Rex: Who could've ever predicted that a computer with a forward stomping premise would allow an even stranger to be made to feel awesome?
T-Rex: Nobody!
