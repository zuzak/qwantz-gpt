T-Rex: Man, I'm great! Why the sudden appearance of a foreign power?

T-Rex: It has been a great deal of a shake-up night for me!

Dromiceiomimus: Why are you yelling at us, T-Rex? You shouldn't be shouting.
T-Rex: Oh, I wasn't shouting! I was just in a different position!
Dromiceiomimus: Well, uh, that's weird. You're not shouting from the same song?
T-Rex: I'm not shouting!

Utahraptor: Somebody's song's got to be holding a song!
T-Rex: THAT'S what I'm saying!

Utahraptor: Well, that's Natalie Portman!
T-Rex: HELLO, YOU'RE A GREAT FRIEND!
Utahraptor: Never have I been so close to having such a tender conversation.
T-Rex: NEVERMIND WORTH IT!

Narrator: LATER, T-REX'S MOVIE DOESN'T GET MADE
T-Rex: Man, let's not be doing that!
T-Rex: Or should I say... NOT WATCHING TV?
