T-Rex: Everyone!
T-Rex: You guys!

T-Rex: Who wants to party?  Because you know who wants to party?
T-Rex: ME.

T-Rex: Anyway, I've been going to the gym all day and I've been doing resistance running, so I know how to move on to the next thing.
Utahraptor: That sounds pretty good!

Utahraptor: Okay, I'll meet you at the gym, the winner of which is the person who has the best place in the world, and then we'll go out for a hot breakfast!
T-Rex: Excellent!  Please spread the word!
Utahraptor: So everyone, spread the word!
Utahraptor: The place is hot!  Make sure your Facebook friends know about it!

T-Rex: !!
T-Rex: WE HAVE TO BE GOOD
