T-Rex: I have been thinking of registering a domain name...

T-Rex: ... on the Internet!

T-Rex: This domain name will have to be something that reflects me and my interests!
T-Rex: Something that says, "This is an awesome dude!" but also says "You should sign the guestbook!"
T-Rex: Hmm...

Utahraptor: I've got a great domain name for you!
T-Rex: Oh boy! What is it?

Narrator: AS THE UTAHRAPTOR PROMISES:
T-Rex: I will pronounce you names that have no meaning at all!
Utahraptor: Sounds great!
T-Rex: I guess I'll say this...

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Daaaaaaaaaaaaamn
