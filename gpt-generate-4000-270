T-Rex: THE EROTIC ROUTER PARTY T-REX PARTY. It's Saturday!  You know what it is?

T-Rex: I know!  And YES, I know that I could be friends with a totally awesome guy just because we've done some research into romantic relationships.  But it's not the point.
T-Rex: THE POINT IS, we're friends on a basic level.  Research has shown that a high metabolism/strong will network synergize well with a low metabolism network!

Utahraptor: That's a great law, but wouldn't it be pretty boring to talk about metabolism and willym-
T-Rex: I guess!

Utahraptor: That's what you want to avoid, T-Rex.  There's no "I made it" after the "I made it."  There's just --
T-Rex: FINE.
Utahraptor: I'm not going to read "DIRECTIONAL SCIENTIFIC METHODS FOR NEUROTOXIC REACTIONS" that way.  That's not the point.
Utahraptor: I suppose it is that the "I made it" sentiment is ... interesting.

T-Rex: It's interesting, because it's the same emotion, a little girl, wonks!  But one that I think is pretty okay, on account of how some dudes like it!
T-Rex: I think it's fair that I'm not the only one with opinions!
