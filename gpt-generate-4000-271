Utahraptor: I poisoned my food, Salt-N-Pepa!

Utahraptor: If I'd eaten the whole thing I could have lived off a small protein shake, but I chose the half-eaten baguette.

T-Rex: I'm not sure I could've done that! Also, would you say you have a allergy to the nutritional facts of the food you're eating?
T-Rex: I'm not 100% sure I could, but I put food in my mouth and eat it!
T-Rex: THERE. THAT. WORKED. OFF. MY. FEAR.
