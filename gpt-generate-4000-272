T-Rex: Did you know that you can now get digital prints for only 29 cents? This will change your life!
Dromiceiomimus: Yes! Now you can have prints for only 29 cents.
T-Rex: Also!
Dromiceiomimus: And now you can have prints for only 29 cents!
T-Rex: Also!

T-Rex: Now if I had a computer I'd use it to make a record for 29 cents!
Utahraptor: 29 cents, you know? That's just the tip of the iceberg!

Utahraptor: But I guess 29 cents is the baseline, if you'll allow me. And at the extreme - you know, "just baseline". It's not like I'm going to get a 29 cent prints soon enough.
T-Rex: I'll just get there first, I swear.

Narrator: DENOUEMENT: 29 cent  prints, YOU GU!
