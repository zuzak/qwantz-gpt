T-Rex: I would like to have an inclined treadmill, so that I could build an indoor skateboarding track.  Am I that crazy?
T-Rex: Am I that crazy... TO DREAM?

T-Rex: Toil and death!

T-Rex: It would be a great indoor track, Dromiceiomimus!  Unsinkable.  No matter how much I skate, if I don't have an indoor skateboard I can't be accused of it truly!
Dromiceiomimus: An indoor track, T-Rex!  You've built an indoor track!
T-Rex: I know!  It is the best indoor track ever invented.

Utahraptor: What's an indoor track?
T-Rex: Kilometers?

Utahraptor: That's only because the word was invented by William Shakespeare in play form!  It was only after he was finished reading the play that he realized "gig" was important.
T-Rex: So, before he was done watching me, he invented an indoor track!
Utahraptor: A track, what?
T-Rex: Kilometres!

T-Rex: It was a great idea!  A great idea that when we added colour to everything, the track would turn against us.  So what's this idea that we're all stupid?
T-Rex: Kilometres?
T-Rex: That's called Photoshop".
