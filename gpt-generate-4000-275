T-Rex: Time for some ...

T-Rex: ... REVEALING PERSONAL TRUTHS ABOUT OURSELVES!

T-Rex: You go first, Dromiceiomimus.

Dromiceiomimus: No, I don't think I'll be revealing any personal truths about myself today.

T-Rex: Okay, that was kind of obvious, Dromiceiomimus. I guess you could say you were "on the ball" with eating a sandwich, only on the ball you said you were.
Dromiceiomimus: On the ball?

T-Rex: On the board, anyway!
Utahraptor: On the board?

T-Rex: YES! Yes, on the ball you said you were.
Utahraptor: Okay.
T-Rex: Okay, well, I guess I'll say you're great at sandwiches, because you're great at sandwiches. On the board you'll say "SORRY ALERT ME: I'M ON THE BALL, AND THAT IS MY BUSINESS"
Utahraptor: No, that one's a little tricky.

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: On the board, ALRIGHT, I wrote "On the board, I realized I can do ALL THE SONG"
Utahraptor: On the board!
T-Rex: YES
T-Rex: THAT'S GREAT
