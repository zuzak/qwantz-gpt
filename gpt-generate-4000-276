T-Rex: How come everything's so rad? I hear everything is super rad!
T-Rex: I ALSO hear inside cars that smell like roses!

T-Rex: And I hear on the radio that the music is just just just just just - oh!  And TV shows and movies just just just pass for what I imagine a living soundtrack orchestra to the symphony of life and music played by the audience.
T-Rex: You know what? I'm not even certain if it's a true music symphony or not.

Utahraptor: You can't say for sure!
T-Rex: Sure!!

Utahraptor: You CAN say for sure.  It's really the beauty of life: you don't know what to believe.  You don't know what to believe in, you don't know if it's real or not.  If it is real, then you believe you were born in the future and you're going to die just like everybody else, but with all the chance of being born again: Proof-short?

Narrator: LATER, T-REX AND UTAHRAPTOR'S MOVIE SOCCER SHIPS TO THE FUTURE:
T-Rex: Hello, my name is Mark-Paul - this is Origin Now!
T-Rex: I'm excited!
