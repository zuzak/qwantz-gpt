T-Rex: I have come up with the ultimate disaster movie!  It is called -
T-Rex: "OH NO, THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BUT WE'RE NEVER OUTSIDE AND THAT ONE IS PRETTY MUCH THE WORST EVER!"

T-Rex: (It's inspired!)

T-Rex: It starts out predictable but then escalates, and soon there are heated scenes!  And the budget for the actors is so low that they bare the face of a camera, and then they look around and say "Oh, I'm so happy for having cameras!"
Dromiceiomimus: Doesn't that sound like a less cordial, DEFINITELY cordlessness-rich direction from the producers of "The Office" to the unprepared mind of a careerist writer?
T-Rex: It does!

Utahraptor: So what happens next?
T-Rex: Was the scene turning cordlessness into a great idea just to send the film's title over the coals?

Utahraptor: No.  What happens next is up in the books.
T-Rex: What?  NOT AWFUL!  I'M AWESOME.
Utahraptor: Dude, "overnight" sounds awesome.  Like it's raining really hard.
T-Rex: It doesn't.

Narrator: THAT EVENING...
T-Rex: THEY SPENT THE PRESENT WITH THEIR LIMBS, TALKING EVERYTHING OVER, NOT HAVING ANY POINTINGS.
T-Rex: Frig!  Good catch!!
T-Rex: ...oh, hey, did you see the movie?
