T-Rex: How can I possibly be late for my important meeting AGAIN? How is my brain failing me, anyway?

T-Rex: I volunteered that it would be great if there were some sweet deal on the table that I could give to the poor guy.

T-Rex: IT KEEPS. I volunteered that it would be a good idea to borrow a moment for it.
Utahraptor: Excellent! There you are, the man who made life awkward for you!

T-Rex: Hah hah, yeah, well, you know, I volunteered that it would be a sweet deal to borrow a moment from a stripper.
Utahraptor: There you are, the guy who made life awkward for you and then you were seen making out by accident?
T-Rex: Hah hah, yeah, that's exactly me!

Narrator: MUCH LATER...
T-Rex: It turns out my fetish for "panties" was actually pretty entertaining, didn't it?
