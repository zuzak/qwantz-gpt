T-Rex: If I ever turn into a werewolf, I would DEFINITELY donate my still-living body to science!  The reason is simple: I Care About Science.

T-Rex: Guys!  The advances would be incredible!

T-Rex: I'd start with the science we all know science was doing when they first came across the remains of some crappy dinosaur: some photos, a few words, a feel - all of it.  And if I ever get a whiff of smelly, I'd exhale.  Close up photos, I guarantee it!  History's over, man!  Pictures of smelly bodies taken by the ACTUAL CHIZ CHEES.

Utahraptor: Are you serious about this, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Science has made some friggin' advances in recent years!

Utahraptor: Science advances so much more than dinosaurs.  It can alter the nature of the fabric of space time.  It can extend the time of our universe by a factor of much DESCRIBING.  In other words, it can extend our lives and knowledge.
T-Rex: I wouldn't be able to.  That's why I'm SO POOCHED.

Narrator: BUT LIGHTNING THAT CONVERSATION:
T-Rex: Are we going to find out what happened to me if I tell you the truth, after I tell you the science??
Utahraptor: Maybe T-Rex is a great guy, but we won't know HIS SATISFACTION ON A scale of one to ten!
T-Rex: I knew some of his opinions would be useful, but I didn't know he actually did some cool things.
Utahraptor: Okay.
T-Rex: 15 to 20 years after he started chilling out with pals, the clock's still ticking.

T-Rex: Hey, remember when we were playing Monopoly in grade 2?
