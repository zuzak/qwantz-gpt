T-Rex: Allusion is the theory of precedence!  It refers to the idea that  words   come before all other words in a word   consist of a single, unnecessary front and you'll always run the risk of pronunciation mistakes.

T-Rex: Anyway!

T-Rex: And it turns out we don't just have access to synonyms for "food" for "sex", "hair", "eye", and "hair": we have access to all sorts of artifacts, both sound and photo ones!  And when we want to talk about something, all we have are artifacts which are named after us!  Name them "music" or "ice-cream".

Utahraptor: How do we know which music is named after us?
T-Rex: Well, there's the Beatles!

T-Rex: And it turns out we don't actually have any real control over the names of art and sound.  It's just - we're willing to give it our all, you know?  Like, I could listen to some Beatles songs and call them "Good Will The Class".  Good.  I'll just live my life according to this maxim of ours.
Utahraptor: How come you don't?
T-Rex: They're so great.  Give me a break!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX IS A METAPHORIST:
T-Rex: The Beatles!  Can you write me a story for my personal audience?
Kate [thinks]: A METAPHORIST story? Okay! How about some johnny p u r?
T-Rex: No thanks!  I really need to set up a meeting and have a manny of dudes!
