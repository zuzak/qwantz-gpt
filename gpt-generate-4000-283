T-Rex: You know what everyone does ALL THE TIME, but none of us get to do it? We GET TO DO IT.

T-Rex: Yep! We meet on the ACTUAL AND/OR REACTION that is, a world power!

T-Rex: We are made of meat, and our bodies are made of many, varied, unpredictable, and deathly! ANYWAY I DON'T KNOW HOW ACTUALLY WE GET A PROMOTE ANSWER, but it's kinda the only way ever!
Dromiceiomimus: That's not death-inducing, T-Rex.
T-Rex: It is! It's a... REACTIVE PHILOSOPHICAL THERMODYMELBOURH??

Utahraptor: And we don't get to experience death on a planetary scale, much less experience it on a NON-diegetic scale!
T-Rex: Nope!

Utahraptor: And yet, we do, somehow, learn about it. Something we've already spent ages digesting, digesting AND preparing for.
T-Rex: No way. Not when we get to die. We're the ultimate ancestors, the nourished offspring of a single, ancient, perfect, but wickedly troubled, creator.

T-Rex:...which, again, means that I should be getting kinda sick of stomping on things and people.
God: YEAH MYSTERY
God: IT'S SUCH A GOOD PARTY
