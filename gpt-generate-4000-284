T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! Oh MAN.  I'll never say this, but I have the best idea for a series of books!

T-Rex: I'll be Dick Tracy!

T-Rex: I will be a stalker! I'll be a time-traveling villain! I'll be a group of super-alikes who never stop trying to do bad things to other people!
T-Rex: Woah.  I'm gonna break it to you, Dromiceiomimus.  I'm sorry I called you a "time-traveling villain" and then I went on to say that you're good to avoid if you're really prepared!

Utahraptor: I'm sorry I called you a "time-traveling villain"!  You should have told you that I said!
T-Rex: Now you're telling me?!

Utahraptor: I said you would!  It's not your fault! You never were part of a dream!
T-Rex: I never am!
Utahraptor: Well, Dick Tracy, I think you should step down from your role as "time-traveling villain" yet I still love you and we'll have a relationship.

T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: I've considered it and decided that it is best to quit his job as an adult and become a super-alike called "Time-Alike", as I have done in the past; and we will have a child!
T-Rex: *ahem*
T-Rex: I have also considered setting up a camp in order to prevent illegal alien crime, as it is my only hope!
