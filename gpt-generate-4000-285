T-Rex: Oh crap! Everybody died!
T-Rex: I'm the last one left on the planet!

Narrator: ONE WORD:
T-Rex: Air is destabilizing the planet's core!

Narrator: THE END

Utahraptor: You're - managing to be dead?
T-Rex: I'm finally, Utahraptor. I just have to say this, okay? I was going to say I'm finally, but the part where the entire universe is watching me is a lie, and you're going to say you're also a liar.

Utahraptor: I say I'm going to say I'm finally, but I can't call!
T-Rex: And I'm going to say that I have Classified Reading for you, but I can't reveal my name because I'm terrified of speaking my name.

T-Rex: Classified Reading for all I know!
