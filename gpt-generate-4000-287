T-Rex: I have come up with a perfect way not to believe in anything ever again.  Evidentialism

T-Rex: A belief is justified only if there is sufficient evidence to support it!

T-Rex: Therefore, I won't believe in anything ever again!  I won't believe in things that don't exist, I won't believe in things that can't exist, I'll believe things that could, and I won't believe in things that can't exist!  ALL EVIDENCE.

Utahraptor: Are you going to say you won't?  I've got a lot of them!
T-Rex: I haven't had a chance to decide yet!

Utahraptor: I've got a lot of them, T-Rex!  You're overthinking it, and not thinking it at all!
T-Rex: Utahraptor!  Just got a letter from the guy!  What did he say?
Utahraptor: Nothing!  Just some innocuous matter.  All I'm saying is I thought it was cool to believe in things that didn't exist, and I didn't think it was me that did that!

Narrator: EARLIER:
T-Rex: If there's a God, I've thought of him as if he's the god of stories!
God: HEY T-REX
T-Rex: Why don't you tell him how all your beliefs are valid?
God: um
God: YEAH I MEAN
