T-Rex: Okay, so APPARENTLY a singular, gender-neutral "they" has a long and proud history as a synonym for "them".

T-Rex: It was even banned from the moon in the 60s

T-Rex: APPARENTLY, even LADIES DID THEIR BEST MAXIMISM when they saw someone using the word "they" instead of "their"!
Dromiceiomimus: But - "best" is PRETTY EXTREMELY AWESOME!
T-Rex: My friend: it really was.

Utahraptor: Still banned?
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: Those who avoided ban time but chose to be anonymous made up their own word, and didn't even check their name on Wikipedia. That's like the point, right? And people kept trying!
Utahraptor: Softer words make the internet faster?
T-Rex: BETTER. Wikipedia still has like 1.5 bps (!) remaining on every single bad decision!

T-Rex: Hah! What could possibly go wrong?
T-Rex: Don't even get me started on that friggin' wallace!
