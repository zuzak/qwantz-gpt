T-Rex: Okay, so APPARENTLY a singular, gender-neutral "they" has a long and proud history in English.  It's especially prominent in the story of Henry, a.k.a. "Horse John".  And now, he's a woman.

T-Rex: ...Actually, that's not entirely true.  "John" is a woman.

T-Rex: "Also, she's got a mouth like your mouth, but instead of a lump, a li'l is wrapped around your head," it's more "Mary sat on her inseminator used as a lookout for you" than "a manger for horses."  We've changed the name of "horse" and "person" to "horse" and "person" and now "horses" means "t-rexined and sexy".

Utahraptor: I think we've just forgotten about "horses" antonio!
T-Rex: What?  We?  For the time being?

Utahraptor: T-Rex, my friend, you should've called "horses" "twinkle" and "twinkle" instead.  The whole "they" thing is just a convenient shorthand for "I forgot about" hook, line, or even motif.
T-Rex: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE REMINDED ME OF THAT SUCKY DREAM I HAD, BUT I SAID
T-Rex: ...Hold on, I can't believe I didn't already know that "horses" is a generic intensifier.  I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T TAKE A FEW ANYMORE.
