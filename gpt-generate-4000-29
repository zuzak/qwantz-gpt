T-Rex: Okay, so APPARENTLY a singular, gender-neutral "they" has a long and proud history.

T-Rex: APPARENTLY, even Willy T. Shakespeare used "they" this way!

T-Rex: And APPARENTLY, I'm not unarguably in the right when I say that "they" is always plural.  FINE.  Everyone makes mistakes; I suppose it's fair that I'd FINALLY get my very first turn at bat.  But that doesn't mean English is getting off scot free! We still need an UNCONTENTIOUS gender-neutral pronoun.
Dromiceiomimus: What happened to "thon"?
T-Rex: In a shouted sentence?
T-Rex: THON NOT KNOW WHY NOBODY LIKE THON

Utahraptor: There are still some other alternatives you haven't considered, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Such as?

Utahraptor: How about "yo? As in, "Yo doesn't know what yo thinks about this."  Or "bitches", as in "Bitches didn't derive that function properly".  Men can be bitches!
T-Rex: Man.  Men CAN be bitches.
T-Rex: Bitches don't even know.

Narrator: Later:
T-Rex: Bitches is now singular, tell bitches.
