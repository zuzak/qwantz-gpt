T-Rex: I have started a radio show! It is about the life of a good friend. Everybody! I say this as a friend, as a person living the dream!

T-Rex: It is almost TOO much of a challenge for a program to do that. Who cares? Everybody ELSE has a great time!

T-Rex: Oh, great: A program is a program if it can be said to have been a good program!
Dromiceiomimus: Does it matter whether it's a good program or not?
T-Rex: It doesn't matter! I'm a program without a program!

Utahraptor: This is your program, my friend! It's good but it's not perfect.
T-Rex: Excellent! Um, what about some of the things that are just WAY better than if I was just describing how terrible everything was on Earth?

Utahraptor: I suppose you're saying that some things are way better than others?
T-Rex: As do I!
Utahraptor: Fine!
T-Rex: Fine!
