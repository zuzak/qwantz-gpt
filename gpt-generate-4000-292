T-Rex: I wonder what the most important day of my life was? Yesterday? Tomorrow? Maybe even...

T-Rex: TODAY?

T-Rex: It's very busy, Dromiceiomimus, and I want to say "thank you" with some accuracy. I meant "glad I had a chance, though, was I wrong?".
Dromiceiomimus: I didn't!
T-Rex: That's - that's fair.

Utahraptor: Plus, do you want to go shopping?
T-Rex: Yes!

Utahraptor: And you, T-Rex, I saw you had a chance today.
T-Rex: QUIT MAKING SURE MORE OF THESE FACTS
Utahraptor: YES AND I JOIN T-REX'S TAX RETIREE

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Excuse me, sir, you look set to receive a new bill for the current fiscal year, for two (2) reasons.
T-Rex: The first is you lookens to me and I'll PAY it, the second is you think about the future this morning and this just makes more sense.
