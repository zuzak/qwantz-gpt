T-Rex: I have finished a new novel! This is my best novel yet, for the simple reason that it includes one critical aspect:

T-Rex: A sex scene!

T-Rex: I find the Koopa Troopa hilarious, Dromiceiomimus. He never forgets, and even when he does, there's never a dull moment.
Dromiceiomimus: Isn't a sex scene necessary, for both audience members and the author?
T-Rex: Heh. No, it doesn't matter what you answer, the plot is what feels real and alive. It's important, because it informs the tension between the author and the reader, and life might go south.

Utahraptor: Well, I guess you don't need sex to have a good story. You need tension, and this book is that: a sex scene!
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: It's important, because it informs the tension between the author and the reader, and life, and ALSO, why the characters keep going after they're pushed around.
Utahraptor: Hey, what were you thinking about "taking the page"?
T-Rex: Um, I just closed in on a wacky store hours ago!

T-Rex: Hah hah! Awesome!
Character 1: Hooray for Hooray for Hooray!!
Narrator: Wait, what was that? It's me: T-Rex! What are you doing here?
T-Rex: I bought you some shoes, Utahraptor!
Character 2:oor, I need you to wear them, because I'll break the law to get them out!!
Narrator: I'll break the law to get your shoes out:  yessssssss
