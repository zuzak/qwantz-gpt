Narrator: COMICS WITH SUDDEN CHANGES IN GENDER
T-Rex: What a nice day to go out and do manly things.

T-Rex: Maybe I'll flip some cars with my male genitals!

Narrator: SUDDENLY!
T-Rex: I'm a chick! Hah hah hah!
T-Rex: Luckily, I can still do the the things I want, because gender can inform, but does not dictate, personality and self.
Dromeciomimus: That is true!

Utahraptor: So now you're a woman?
T-Rex: Genderly speaking!

Narrator: SUDDENLY!
T-Rex: Wait, now I'm a man again! Hah hah hah!
Utahraptor: Does everyone laugh like an evil, mustacho-twirling madness?
T-Rex: Yep!

Narrator: SUDDENLY!
T-Rex: Wait, now I'm a daffy ghost! Hah hah hah!
T-Rex: Wait! That is an approximation of my voice!
