T-Rex: FACT: senior citizens are fragile. You can't shove them around or nothing!

T-Rex: FACT: babies are fragile too! So apply these to your OWN baby!

T-Rex: You could put "Superman is fragile" in front of Superman and talk like a man, but then you could also talk like a man, bit by bit, suffering internal corrosion and aging... into semi-living flesh.
Dromiceiomimus: That's an old joke! Superman would use it!
T-Rex: PRETTY SURE Superman!

Utahraptor: Can we do that?
T-Rex: Sure!!

T-Rex: If you don't want to apply physical science to your own work, that's fine, that's okay, whatever! I've got nothing against Superman, dude!
Utahraptor: Really? For a second there, I thought you were racist.
T-Rex: FINE. But then I realized: wait, if I was doing it all "properly" OH HEY I'M SORRY BUT I'M NOT RACIST

T-Rex: From now on I'm doing my best
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus!
T-Rex: DON'T LISTEN TO MY STUMPING BODY

{{Title text: i just saw a live baby growing inside its arms growing inside its stomach growing inside its mouth growing inside its mouth growing inside its mouth growing inside its mouth"
