T-Rex: In the 15th and 16th centuries, spoken English was transformed from passive to active: printers and this writer could print anything! It's how we first invented writing that's been standing for this long.

T-Rex: It's how we first invented language.

T-Rex: In this golden age of writing, when spoken English was ahead of the curve, we all knew it was time to get on with things like maintainer's hats and bell tolls, "making out on the side" and cleaner grammar.
Dromiceiomimus: I think you're forgetting one bit! BEFORE THAT ACTIVITY WAS A JOB WE BOUGHT WE JUST WISH TO CREATE.
T-Rex: Nuh-uh! Before we tried "saudin' on the side", we expected a lot of upsides!

T-Rex: I've got some business to do!
Utahraptor: Then you go to sleep and dream you're caught in a mirror, and then you wake up.

T-Rex: Aaand that's gross!
