Narrator: COMICS WITH SUDDEN CHANGES IN GENDER
T-Rex: What a nice day to go out and do manly things.

T-Rex: Maybe I'll flip some cars with my male genitals!

Narrator: SUDDENLY!
T-Rex: I'm a chick! Hah hah hah!
T-Rex: Luckily, I can still do the the things I want, because gender can inform, but does not dictate, personality and self.
Dromieo: I do not deny that!
T-Rex: A good day for women is a good day for men!

Narrator: THINGS THAT COULD GO WRONG WITH A HOUR HOUR HOUR
T-Rex: Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong!
Utahraptor: Not a problem!

Narrator: ENJOY THE DAY!
T-Rex: Oh, I just think I'd get tired of them.
Utahraptor: Feel free to correct me if I'm right!
T-Rex: Oh, by the way! That's not a problem!

Narrator: ENJOY THE DAY WITH ONLY THE THING THAT COULD GO WRONG
T-Rex: So... if there was a problem, what did she do?
God: T-REX SEND ME A SIGN THAT SAYS "WRITING IS FOR SIX"
T-Rex: That sounds like she's mad at you.
God: LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED
