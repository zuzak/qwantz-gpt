T-Rex: So - wait. Wait. I could do that, in MY house.

T-Rex: But THEN it would be cool, I could play in the backyard, AND there would be nothing but grass and flowers on my way out!

Utahraptor: That's a terrible idea, T-Rex! What comes after that?
T-Rex: Awesome, I guess!

Utahraptor: Awesome, and then you can come over for dinner and YOU can't just sit in the same bed, talking rattling my catwood and my rattling my pots. What's the point of that?
T-Rex: The GOOD NEWS is that Dromiceiomimus and I are friends, and in return we get to eat each other!
Utahraptor: That's - that's actually awesome.

Utahraptor: And my secret to friendship is named after me, if you don't mind!
T-Rex: So? Hello! You don't mind!
Utahraptor: No, I just mind.
T-Rex: So. . .
T-Rex: You do mind.
