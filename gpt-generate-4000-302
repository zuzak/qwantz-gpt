Narrator: DINO CHUCKLES

T-Rex: This is a joke to confirm what I already said!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I am a large monoculture farm, which means that I get to eat a lot of meat!  I didn't know this before!
Dromiceiomimus: Why are you talking about meat?  Why not just rename it to "Mushroom Meat"
T-Rex: I love meat!

Utahraptor: I'm not sure what you're trying to get accomplished here, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I was just wondering if you noticed with other animals or inanimate objects, or if there were differences that you managed to bring about some of the changes you were attempting?

Utahraptor: Not really, because other animals too have their own problems!
T-Rex: Aha, my friend!  I forgot that Iiberian jive, and added in some life lessons to make it even more awesome.

Utahraptor: Man, you can't just add ons!  If we divided the money we make by owning and accumulating space in our bodies according to the mass of the planet, how'd you DO it?
T-Rex: I guess!  I find that I am never more than a little overzealous in my attempts to understand the world around me.
T-Rex: Aww, Utahraptor!  I love you!
