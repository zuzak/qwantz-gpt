T-Rex: Who here wants to watch me eat a sandwich?
God: SURE
God: NO

T-Rex: Wow, who cares? I love eating sandwiches!

T-Rex: I mean, I love them. I love the thought of eating a sandwich at such a great restaurant!
Dromiceiomimus: I get the appeal, but I really don't get the substance of the thing.  What do you get when you eat a sandwich?
T-Rex: I do enjoy eating some fried chicken parts, but generally just a wiry old man is a wispsively delicious sandwich.

Utahraptor: Really?  That's the point!
T-Rex: It's not my point!

T-Rex: I just want to know how to eat a sandwich!  I just learned it!
Utahraptor: Ah.  Ah. Well. That's certainly a skill learned by a ULTIMATE EUPHITIONER of God!

God: HOW DID YOU KNOW I COULD STEAL ANYTHING
T-Rex: Not really!  Was it learned by a CHEMICAL INTUITIONer?
God: T-REX I GET DEAD COOL
