T-Rex: Some words are shorthand for longer words or phrases that we no longer use.

T-Rex: For example, "factory" is short for "manufactory"!

T-Rex: Incredible, no? And when we say "pecs", we're actually saying the short form of "pectoral muscles"!
Dromiceiomimus: What?  I thought they were called "pecs" because it stands for "Pretty Erotic Chest Section"!!

Utahraptor: My mind's being blown over here!
T-Rex: Well prop it up, 'cause it's gonna be blown even harder!

T-Rex: "Adult" is short for "adult baby", but the long form is rarely used because it makes everyone sound weird.  "In a democracy, adult babies elect a set of adult babies to lead them, usually represented by the head of state.  This is called 'the baby', or 'the check"!"
Utahraptor: That's stupid.
T-Rex: I know!  I'm totally going to stop being that stupid baby all by myself.

Narrator: THE END
Narrator: P.S. - By the way, "baby" is a corruption of "pecs", which means a bunch of tiny pecs.
T-Rex: THAT'S SUCKS NO MORE, BABY.
