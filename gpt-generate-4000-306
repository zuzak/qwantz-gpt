T-Rex: Natural language processing researchers are all, "Oh boo hoo, computationally generating and understanding natural language is hard, we totally need more time to build Data from Star Trek, boo hoo hoo!"

T-Rex:Looks like you dropped the ball, NLP researchers!!

T-Rex- Because MY email autoresponder takes in text with all sorts of imperfect and rreguar language, disambiguates word sense, builds a semantic understanding AND generates an appropriate response in the time it would take a real person to type it out. Oh snap! Did a rank amateur, wanting only to ensure that his body wouldn't be discovered for a few years after he died, just brutally advance the state of the art? SEEMS LIKE IT BABY!

Utahraptor: So how's it work?
T-Rex: Just fine, thank you!

T-Rex: No, I'm actually just saying that email is a pretty good medium, if imperfect. But you can take someone's email and tweak it to your specifications. And you can do that over and over, with or without the use of spam. I'm talking spam where the only missing piece is the dead body of a loved one! NOBODY HAS EVER SAID that.
Utahraptor: Aw boo!

Narrator: HAMLET:
T-Rex: I've got two words for you, objectively and creatively, Justin!
