T-Rex: I just got off a bus featuring the World's Cryiest Baby. Oh man, what a relief!

T-Rex: Here's a tip: SOME babies need to learn to cry a little less!

Dromiceiomimus: That's a terrible thing to say, T-Rex! You can't blame a BABY for crying!
T-Rex: I know, I know! I was just a little prude to get off a bus! On my birthday I borrowed a little cup from a lady who had just bought it, and then said "Oh, that is a lovely cup! Excellent! And, SCENE!

Utahraptor: And then she said, "Oh, that is a lovely gift! Excellent! AND, I don't know what to think about this!"
T-Rex: Utahraptor! It's a little thing called "bakery-bakery" (in there somewhere)!

T-Rex: I freely admit that I didn't open it up up with the bakery and friend and then try to explain that to the guy who's supporting me.
Utahraptor: ...Does that mean the jerk decided he liked my cup of cupcakes?
T-Rex: ...I don't know. I think they're weird!

T-Rex: Whatever! I was a leader and a good T-Rex guy, and I'm still a leader of lesser beings!
T-Rex: I'm still a thief and a good T-Rex guy is someone's friend!
