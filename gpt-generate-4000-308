Narrator: A CAUTIONARY TOY:
Narrator: T-REX AND THE BEACH LADY CREEPY

T-Rex: What's up with washing your hands of any sort of food?
Dromiceiomimus: No worries, T-Rex! I'll wash my hands with soap and repeat on repeat.
T-Rex: Do you wash your hands afterwards?
Dromiceiomimus: I think you must have fancy hands, like those of a princess, T-Rex.

Utahraptor: I don't see why you can't, when it comes to washing your hands!
T-Rex: Ooh! Or yours!

Utahraptor: But you don't have a set routine: you're always on the lookout for any weakness.
T-Rex: Is that true? Or do you keep your eye on the prize?
Utahraptor: Hmm... seems to me that the reason people keep washing their hands is simply because they're getting a better deal!

T-Rex: I see. That's what I'm going to do. Well, for the record, I'm NOT washing my hands.
