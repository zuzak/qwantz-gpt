T-Rex: I like it when commercials license pop songs and then make up their own brand! It's a good thing corporate slogans are rarely trendy.

T-Rex: Corporations want us to buy ads!

T-Rex: They risk leaving one of their most iconic slogans in an accident, and indeed, in the case of this trial the CRIME of "abusive celebrity" is that they license it at the same time!
Dromiceiomimus: But doesn't the advertising industry claim that "acoustic advertising" is done so secretly?
T-Rex: ...Yes?

Utahraptor: "The undercover agent was so impressed with his ex-wife that he pretended to outplay her performances entirely, saving only a single sheet of paper."
T-Rex: Aww!

Utahraptor: Okay, you're all going to jail, I'm - I'm - I'm not.
T-Rex: I'm not, Utahraptor! I'm not.

T-Rex: I freely admit that even while I was ahead of this trial I wrote the whole thing scripturally. It was fun!
Utahraptor: What was it like?
T-Rex: It was great! I got more out of the whole deal by ACTUALLY paying the fines instead of just agreeing to barely know what was going on.

T-Rex: I have a part in the whole thing, and I'm really excited to get it out there. I kinda want to break into a few things and then put the screws down.
