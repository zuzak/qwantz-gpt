Narrator: THINGS I'VE READ ON THE INTERNET COMICS
Narrator: a comic to read when I get home

T-Rex: I have! I read everything you can read!

T-Rex: But I've also read EVERYTHING you can read!
Dromiceiomimus: Is that true?
T-Rex: EVERYTHING, Dromiceiomimus! I used to be a scientist, but I'm thanks to you. I'm certain there's nowhere left unexplored on anything!

Utahraptor: I bet there are some even YOU know that you're "so close" that you'll never find out just how far away the Universe was!

T-Rex: That is a fair compliment!
Utahraptor: Really? Really? I thought you were too close to know anything, but have you considered reading even the ENTIRE REST OF THE UNIVERSE?

T-Rex: I wrote Spider-Man fan fiction!
T-Rex: Only he's a different Manfic!
