T-Rex: Which dude spent their weekend painting themselves into all the famous works of art?
T-Rex: Oh snap!!

T-Rex: I'm pretty sure it was this dude!!

T-Rex: Is that ME sitting at the last supper? I believe it is! Is that me poking my head in front of the Mona Lisa, obscuring her face entirely? COULD THAT HANDSOME VISAGE BELONG TO ANYONE ELSE?
Dromiceiomimus: You painted yourse -
T-Rex: Is that ME playing poker with dogs? Yes! Is that me riding the backseat of a rearing horse with Napoleon? YES. OH WAIT, I KNOW, I'M SORRY I AM JUST SAYING MY EXCUSES ARE NOT IN RECORD-TIME VIA AHHHH

Utahraptor: Let me guess: you did this to teach yourself painting?
T-Rex: Yep! Partially!

T-Rex: The other reason is that I know this guy with a fallout shelter, so I'm giving him the paintings. That way, in the case of NUCLEAR APOCALYPSE, future remnants of civilization may have only my paintings to go off of.
Utahraptor: ... And eventually they'll think you're this really great, important guy! That's not what I meant!

T-Rex: Precisely!! I figure, sheesh, SOMETHING good has to come out of the nuclear apocalypse, you know?
Utahraptor: You know, I don't know...ocaust?
