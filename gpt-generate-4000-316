Narrator: PART TWO

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I'll tell you one thing. You're an insanely dangerous man.
Dromiceiomimus: But I'll do it for you! And only you, T-Rex, would go on to say that there's nothing inherently wrong with having some instincts, and that even if they are flawed, those instincts still have REAL LIFE applications.
T-Rex: I guess that would be a lesson in humility, Dromiceiomimus...
Dromiceiomimus: That is a very good point, T-Rex.

Narrator: PART THREE
Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex! I-
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!

T-Rex: Hey, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: For reals this time of day, I'm sorry but I can't. I've got one more thing to report on the horizon.
T-Rex: Oh?

Utahraptor: Your personal information, T-Rex! It's onlyadin the CHANGE of my name to... YOUR OWN.
T-Rex: That sounds like a real nice idea! I dunno, maybe you should change your name to something more descriptive, like "I"?
Utahraptor: Yeah!
Utahraptor: Like... someone with messy, doctor-to-doctor relationships?

Narrator: CONGRATULATIONS
