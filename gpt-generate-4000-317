T-Rex: I have finally come up with a way to become immortal! It's perfect, because I don't have to do anything except DIE, and I was already probably going to do that anyway!

T-Rex: Yes, all I have to do is be reincarnated. Indefinitely!

T-Rex: Isn't that great, Dromiceiomimus? We can have this conversation as many times as we want! I can stomp on things forever!
Dromiceiomimus: well - what form of reincarnation are you talking about here? A lot of people believe that if you're bad in this life, you might come back as a lower animal the next time, like a sucky dog or a poo bug.
T-Rex: AW MAN! Sucky dogs? POO bugs??

T-Rex: Poo bugs are SCIENTIFICALLY the lamest sorts of bugs!
Utahraptor: And you're still stomping!

T-Rex: Well, I can't stop now! Besides if I DO come back as a poo bug, then there's not much damage I can do, right? Maybe I'll get stomped on by some other dude and that other dude will DEFINITELY ask why I'm here.
Utahraptor: I don't think that's what you meant!
T-Rex: SECONDS?

T-Rex: I don't know! I've just come up with an awesome way to ask questions that nobody else can get. Just follow me on Twitter and say the subject you want to talk about, and then you can GET IN ON EVERYONE.
T-Rex: Man!! I would never want to talk about poo bugs!!
