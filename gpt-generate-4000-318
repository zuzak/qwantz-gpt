T-Rex: What if you wrote a story about modern technology arriving BEFORE it did in our timeline? You'd have computers made out of brass and steam! That sounds like it might be...AWESOME?

God: THAT IS WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE
T-Rex: Okay whatever!

T-Rex: In the story we're all hanging out with God is all! Technology has arrived, people are hanging out with it, and we're hanging out with it. Nap went live on DSC000! It's time for us to reproduce it...through science!
Dromiceiomimus: You want to be a video game developer?
T-Rex: Oh my gosh no! Because, you know, while they may have the best engine yet- a game we all love! A game that is accessible and that can pierce the walls of society and be experienced in private!

Utahraptor: You're going for over 1300 words? That's quite a many.
T-Rex: With that it becomes our own! We're going for what's called "hardcore T-Rex", for those who identify with the cause.

T-Rex: We're going for "today's youth, the hard way".
T-Rex: We're going for "suck on T-Rex", "I suck, not on T-Rex", and "I suck, not as good as when I suck."
T-Rex: Just a li'l about.
