Dromiceiomimus: I sure can!

T-Rex: Excellent!!

T-Rex: EVEN BETTER!!
T-Rex: But, as you can see, I've bought in to a tradition.

Narrator: T-REX AND DROMICEIOMIMUS PARTIED EXTREMELY HARD LAST NIGHT

Utahraptor: So you don't think it's original.
T-Rex: Nope! I think it's over AEDLIED.

T-Rex: It's an ORIGINAL song that, while technically and conclusively true, still sounds great.  Let's hear it for yourself.
Utahraptor: Okay, what about the trumpet solo?  Isn't that a bit derivative?
T-Rex: Let us NOT be loaded!

Narrator: WHAT ABOUT THE MOONWAYPLAYING IN THE WALL AND THE FIREFLY MUSIC BOARD COVER AND ON ACCOUNT OF HOW IT RATES BIASED SELECTION?
T-Rex: Let us not be loaded!!
