T-Rex: What if I made a joke about a Nazi submarine sinking my family's submarine in one sitting?
T-Rex: I'd laugh!

T-Rex: I mean, I guess I'd say "kek", "forke", "forke", because I find those words SO DELICIOUS that I make jokes about using them all the time!
T-Rex: "I never sank!"
T-Rex: "Never!"

T-Rex: I'll always have jokes that work, Dromiceiomimus! Killer.
Dromiceiomimus: Well, anyway, I'm sorry, but we don't have any subs. I'm sure we'll get by.
T-Rex: aww, it's just a stupid joke

Utahraptor: Hey, I heard you were using "k" when making jokes?
T-Rex: Sure! And I will ensure my continued survival by using only my own humor!

Utahraptor: Okay, you don't have a subs, do you?
T-Rex: That's cool! A little weird, I guess?
Utahraptor: Okay, well, we'll talk about that today. You can watch the whole thing on the go, but you can also subs, mr sinkholes.

Narrator: SOON:
Off-Panel: subs! HOW'S THE SINKSFLY?
T-Rex: Excellent! SO MANY sinkholes that I'm certain they'd be mistaken for a second home, a literal REindeer in holodeck!
T-Rex: I've always wanted to go back in time and sinkholes, like - all the way?
