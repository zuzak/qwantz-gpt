Narrator: HOW TO ATTRACT MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX
T-Rex: Yes! THIS is a topic I know ALL ABOUT.

T-Rex: Okay! The first way is to draw attention to your hips!

T-Rex: This is because women have larger more flared hips than men do, on account of secondary sexual characteristics! So all heterosexual men cannot help but find women's hips UTTERLY FASCINATING, and all heterosexual women find men's hips FLABBERGASTINGLY EROTIC.
Dromiceiomimus: I've never really been that into hips, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Perhaps that is because you have a case of the perversions!

T-Rex: The second way is to draw attention to your skull!
Utahraptor: You mean face?

T-Rex: Nope, skull! Men have heavier skulls than women, so again, men find light skulls unbelievably sexy, and women find heavy skulls ASTONISHINGLY GORGEOUS.
Utahraptor: Hah! I'll bet you five dollars we can't find even one porn site that's about heavy and light skulls.

Narrator: BUT SOON, HILARIOUS CONSEQUENCES!
T-Rex: Utahraptor! Searching for internet fetish pornography has robbed me of any erotic desires I may have once had!
Utahraptor: Me too!
Utahraptor and T-Rex: Let's never look at our bodies again!!
