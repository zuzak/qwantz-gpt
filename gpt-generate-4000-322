T-Rex: Oh crap oh crap!!
T-Rex: I thought we were done for!

T-Rex: Now we're closer to wrapping up a big "tour" together!

T-Rex: We'll be out seeing a lot of "The Man Who Puke Beer into the Water, Still In The Same Orange: The Forbidden Fruit" and "Just Another Utahraptor's View of Orgasm: The Flawed History of Sex, Orgasm, and Porn, T-Rex" sort of things. Maybe one day I'll explore pornography and find a way to make t-REX Puke Beer into the very same stream of erotic fiction!

Utahraptor: I guess it's a constant in your life you want to keep an eye on?
T-Rex: What? No, of course not!

Utahraptor: You're immortal and you don't even have to worry about your bodies anymore! Observe:
T-Rex: I will fulfill your every need for pornography AND pornography for me, forever!
Utahraptor: Sure!

T-Rex: You'll never have your every need meet and now you canmorry! "You can't take it back." Or "I can't commit to being a long-serving member of a sexually reproducible and somehow suboptimal social group."
T-Rex: "Losing your job may be the LAST PLEXIBLE way to be famous and/or rich!"
T-Rex: "OH, WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE But remember when he was still a studentgirl? I bet I could use that on my next adventure!"
