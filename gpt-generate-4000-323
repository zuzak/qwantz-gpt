T-Rex: Oh crap! Everybody died!
T-Rex: I should've been out of here

Narrator: THE END

Narrator: ALTERNATE Book of Quotations:
T-Rex: Shakespeare wrote it himself, maybe he was the greatest author of ANY SENSE ever!
Shakespeare: to be honest with you my best time writing came from back in the day when I bought a can full of old copies of Hamlet and Pippin had a can full of can straws
T-Rex: Hamlet is pretty good too!
T-Rex: I know! I may have been over 19!

Utahraptor: You were totally only twenty when it was revealed that you could write your own story!
T-Rex: Yes! It was a great idea!

T-Rex: I wrote down the plot of every Sleeping Beauty I ever touch and just left it at that. The end!
Utahraptor: You know what? It's only fair.
T-Rex: Never have a Sleeping Beauty touched so many lives!

T-Rex: It was a dream come true! My imagination and intentions were clear!
