T-Rex: Let's say you can live in any time period in history. Which period do you choose?

T-Rex: The whole universe?

Dromiceiomimus: Ah, the whole universe, yeah.
T-Rex: Okay, some bad things have happened, but you keep seeing them, right? This helps me remember the past.
Dromiceiomimus: I like the future.
T-Rex: And I like the good times ahead, Dromiceiomimus.

Utahraptor: The past can be unsettling, isn't it?
T-Rex: Man, this is the downside of that: it makes me nervous when I die.

Utahraptor: Not the downside, actually: you kinda hate yourself for the past you got erased from history, but the fact that you're here now just means you had a little more breathing room.
T-Rex: I know! And, you're welcome!

Narrator: SHORTLY:
T-Rex: MEMENTO MORRIS
