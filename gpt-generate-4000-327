T-Rex:  Hello and welcome to "Good Grief!  So Sexy!"

T-Rex:  So here's the story:  I was down at the beach and had just finished eating dinner when suddenly and without warning, an enormous weight lifted from my back entirely off the ground!
T-Rex:  As I was about to say the words that start "Good Grief" fade into memory and I am left with the sound of my own mind shattering!
T-Rex:  Then, as I was about to say the words, a tremendous weight was placed on my shoulders!

Utahraptor:  I'm pretty sure he was describing the weight placed on you by you!
T-Rex:  Oh, it's true!  I'd be tempted to spend my life over them!

T-Rex:  But you know what they would do?  I'd be spooked!  I'd be TOTALLY PRONOUNCED!
Utahraptor:  Ah, the hypothetical Lando Calrissian.  You're just a few feet away from me, in this very moment, is about to give me a text that says "So hey, I somehow WON'T give you anymore unsolicited texts, okay?  I still got the text from last night that says 'wow, maybe you should'!"

Narrator:  LATER:
T-Rex:  And I was worried that if I mentioned that I didn't give you any texts, you'd be so quiet that I couldn't see anything that would make me want to give you any texts at all: my quiet.
T-Rex:  "I still got the text from last night that says 'wow, maybe you should'!"
