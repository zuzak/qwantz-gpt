T-Rex: I have the greatest idea for a movie!  I've said this before but this time it's for serious.  There's this cop, right?

T-Rex: Right!

T-Rex: And he's a "by-the-books" cop who does everything "by-the-books".  But one day a big crime is committed and the only guy who knows anything about it is this criminal: a criminal who is prone to cracking wise!  So the cop and the criminal have to team up to stop the bad guys before they commit crimes again.  And at the end they have learned to respect each other's way of life, and they hug for a while.  Five stars!

Utahraptor: Aw, T-Rex, come on.  Why would a "by-the-books" cop team up with a criminal?
T-Rex: Um, TO SOLVE CRIMES??

Utahraptor: But he's by the books!  I don't think there's anything in the "books" about deputizing criminals to go after other criminals.  Why wouldn't he just interrogate him to get the information he needs?
T-Rex: . . .The movie takes place on a planet where interrogation is banned.
