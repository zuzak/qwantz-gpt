T-Rex: I'm tired of things being different. I don't want to be a regular person in a very modern sense. I want something new and empathetic and emollient!

T-Rex: Something wonderful and somehow non-paraphrasing!

T-Rex: Something thoughtful and caring and having a say in things I don't have control over!
T-Rex: Something even sinister and sad and still somehow not me!
T-Rex: Something awesome and somehow not me at all!
T-Rex: Something awesome and somehow not me at all!
T-Rex: Something ... something ...

Utahraptor: I think it's cool that we don't have regular words, T-Rex! It gives us something to talk about!
T-Rex: Oh yeah?

Utahraptor: Yeah! We had words for everything! Something to convey a person's gender, something to compliment a beauty or a disease or a situation or a story!
T-Rex: THAT'S what I meant! By "something to compliment a beauty or a disease or a situation".
Utahraptor: Well, by "something to compliment a beauty or a disease".

T-Rex: Oh! God. Okay: it's thanks to "hugs" that we can discuss these trivial matters.
T-Rex: That's a good thing, Utahraptor!
