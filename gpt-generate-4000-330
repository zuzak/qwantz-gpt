T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others! I will consider, in the name of reason and logic, what happened!

T-Rex: An Empire!

T-Rex: It seems evident that you, as a personification of this truth, failed to see this problem.  You seemed to miss the boat on so many levels.
T-Rex: For one, you seemed to assume that everyone on your planet has some finite number of failures, and you believed that this was the case. You seemed to expect me to point this out of you, so that you could say "Screw you, man! You're way to many failures!"

Utahraptor: Was it the 20th century, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I guess.

Utahraptor: Well, that's just the nature of reasonableness! Remember?
T-Rex: Or the philosophy of deduction!
Utahraptor: Or reasonableness itself, I guess.

Utahraptor: I had thought you'd find reasons to be more consistent, and I suppose that seemed to have led to an initial sense of "I've got it somehow, figured it out, now that I've got nobody to blame but myself!"
T-Rex: Aha, man!  Remember?
