T-Rex: I am a guy who just plain loves ice cream.

T-Rex: It's kind of a letdown to have to share; I've got my own car and cookants and little-to-no-good ice cream flavours sprouting up all over my house.

Utahraptor: What if I don't want to eat cream anymore?
T-Rex: Hmm!

T-Rex: That's okay! I might just give up the old "ice cream is bad and you should eat it" thing and just enjoy the taste of cream.
Utahraptor: I might be like, "Man, using cream is fine! I just don't care."
T-Rex: Then I might eat some and then, I guess "Forget it, I've eaten all the ice cream."

Narrator: YEARS LATER:
T-Rex: Wait! Nobody's eating all the ice cream!
T-Rex: ATTENTION, all diners: I ate all the ice cream!!
