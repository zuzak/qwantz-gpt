T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!

T-Rex: I will consider it as a public service!

T-Rex: To begin: your indifference to the problems of the world reminds me of a thing I haven't bothered to do in the past.  Millions of people starving, warring with hunger, desperate for a break - you know, the usual.  I'm sick of it!  You should do the same thing again.
Dromiceiomimus: You seem to be having none of your problems.
T-Rex: Perhaps not!

Utahraptor: You seem to be having many of your problems!
T-Rex: Oh, that's true!

T-Rex: I wonder what is bothering you.  Are you worried that when you become a famous person the attention you get is gone, making you a target of hate?
Utahraptor: Well - I guess so.  If that's the case, maybe you are too busy with your special job to really interest yourself in the real world?

T-Rex: That's true.  This was I TOTALLY SELLING DINOSAUR AS WELL, so I'm really glad we're friends.
T-Rex: I'm not!
