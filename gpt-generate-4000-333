T-Rex: In high school a bunch of us were talking about a television show!

Narrator: REGRET COMICS 2000

T-Rex: We were all like, "I can't believe it's a terrible thing to say, but - "), and then we all said "Oh yeah?", and then "NICE", and then "PRETTY SWEET." and then "I wish I had never said that!"

Utahraptor: Was it deliberate?
T-Rex: No, not at all! It was just - it was exciting.

T-Rex: "If I were a boy I would say: 'Here's a tip: if you kiss your eyelid accidentally, it can get slightly dry.' " And I'd say, "T-Rex, I wish I had said that even more! It was real nice to kiss on the dry eyelid."
Utahraptor: Really? That's so amazing.

T-Rex: "I wish I had said that even more... DOGS"?
Utahraptor: I thought you were talking about - doggy bits?
T-Rex: I'm surprised you didn't notice, Utahraptor
