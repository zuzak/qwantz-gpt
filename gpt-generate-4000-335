T-Rex: If there were a soundtrack to my life, what would it sound like I wonder?

T-Rex: Imagine if it had vocals! And a drum solo!

T-Rex: It'd be awesome!

T-Rex: Here there would be some ominous music - FOR WILL THE GIRL SURVIVE?
Utahraptor: Wait!

Utahraptor: The idea of a soundtrack to a person's life is a stupid idea. You need a MAGIC HISTORY to live up to!
T-Rex: I see hope in that!!

Narrator: A FEW YEARS LATER...
T-Rex: I'm back from the future! And I'm glad I guess I was left behind!
