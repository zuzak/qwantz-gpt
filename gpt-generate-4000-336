T-Rex: "Now they show you how detergents take out bloodstains - a pretty violent image there! I think if you've got a T-shirt with a bloodstain all over it..."

T-Rex: "... maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem!"

T-Rex: "Maybe if you had a little more laundry, you wouldn't be so bloodstains all over yourselves!"
Dromiceiomimus: I know, I got this one.
T-Rex: Exactly! If I had more laundry, I suspect: I'd be less of a killer laundry. I suspect also that by putting more laundry in, I'd be less of a killer laundry.

Utahraptor: But there's no mistaking that this is an allegory about the world we create for our laundry!
T-Rex: Yes!

Utahraptor: The moral is this: if you create worldliness, you reduce the good guys to routine tasks and then you reduce the bad guys to chores!
T-Rex: No, I don't understand. What are you two doing here?
Utahraptor: I'm in a world where the average person is like, "Warm laundry"?
T-Rex: I'm in a world where they can get by just not having to work too much, and that's not a world that I want to live in.

T-Rex: I like to be able to feel like a chore, you know? I like it when a book says I'm 'too tired to give a wreath its own shape'"
T-Rex: That - that's more like my problem is that I don't have a job!
T-Rex: And I don't like it when a book says I'm 'too stressed to give a wreath its own shape'"
