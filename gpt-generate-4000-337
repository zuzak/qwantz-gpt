T-Rex: I have the ultimate CONVERSATION FILLER. Now no longer will there be awkward pauses in my conversations! Oh yes. No longer.

T-Rex: Because whenever I don't know what to say, I'll just exclaim "Sounds like a good date!"

T-Rex: An example! Dromiceiomimus - can you describe your ideal waterslide for me?
Dromiceiomimus: Um, sure! It's long, I guess, with lots of twists and turns, and some parts are dark so I guess there'sfor basically hard to detect. There's definitely no magic there. It's a fake date. I'll just get on with it.
T-Rex: Well, that's not my example, that's your ideal waterslide!

Utahraptor: So what's your ideal date?
T-Rex: A date easy to understand!

T-Rex: I'm just saying, it's one thing to want a date. Another is you want to say things like "I'm really interested in having a threesome", and you want to set it up so when you get a chance, you're going to say things like "Oh man - SO SWEET. I'll just use my heart to express it!"
Utahraptor: That sounds like a terrible idea.
T-Rex: How -

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Man, parties are about having fun, right? And it turns out having a good party is actually kind of a fun thing to do, especially if you ended up having a bad one!
T-Rex: (You can't tell!)
