T-Rex: It's been a rough week for good luck!  Well, for bad luck!

Narrator: THE WALK OF SHAME

T-Rex: All that's left of the Great War of English for American offers no real legitimacy, and only makes sense if you consider what happened next: a British army general goes head-to-head with a Spanish general to win the world cup!
Dromiceiomimus: What?  No, I got that, byer or not.  Also that's why British flags fly half-way.
T-Rex: Not like that's gonna happen again.  Like... Mona Lisa?

Utahraptor: War, huh?  That's a pretty well-known name!
T-Rex: That's her real name, Patrick.

Utahraptor: And Batman has a similar - and legally and creatively distinct - name?
T-Rex: Batman Begins?  Batman Begins But No, I Pretend I Pretend I Pretend I Pretend I Pretend I remembers you Sign me up for email updates

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE THEY DRESS AROUND MURDER:
T-Rex: Aw dang, man!  Forget I said that!
T-Rex: Forget I said that!!
