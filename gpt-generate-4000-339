Narrator: GREETINGS T-REX I HAVE THE FOLLOWING QUERY FOR YOU
Narrator: WHICH IS THE BEST ENTERPRISE
T-Rex: Oh my gosh all my life I have been training for this question!
T-Rex: *ahem*

T-Rex: It all depends on what you mean by "best"!

T-Rex: Obviously I have the best one.
T-Rex: But you can't have both!
I'll come up with an ethical high ground!
Utahraptor: Why not?

Utahraptor: Well, to be fair, both have done very well, and I think they're doing a pretty good job.
T-Rex: But - ethics are about trusting one fact with another! I was wondering if you knew anyone who does this?
Utahraptor: Well, if you had a large pool, wouldn't you want to see someone who's happy?

T-Rex: A small person, perhaps?
Utahraptor: Perhaps someone who's happy with their current lifestyle?
T-Rex: Someone who's happy for you?
