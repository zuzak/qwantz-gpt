T-Rex: I am not a dude who usually has a big belly. In fact, judging me by the size of my belly is probably the only way I can possibly be judged, and judged by the size of my belly!

T-Rex: Oh well.

T-Rex: That's not to say that I'm bad at it, that's just that I'm not one of those guys who does that.  I just have a case of the wrongness of belly flopping.

Utahraptor: Oh man, I'm not the sort of guy who does that.
T-Rex: Utahraptor, please!

T-Rex: You came, anyway. You didn't boink.  I had some research into belly flopping and it turned out you can never be certain of a guy's worthiness without knowing who the guy is and what his worthiness stands to gain.
Utahraptor: That's alright, T-Rex. I'll see you next time!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX IS A COLONIST!
T-Rex: You want to know who the King of England was?
God: MAYBE HE WAS
T-Rex: Aw, shoot!  Why was he the one who got me into this game?
God: HOW THE HELL DID YOU EVEN START PLAYING IT
