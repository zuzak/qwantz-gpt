T-Rex: I have the best joke for Dromiceiomimus. Me! It's so great.

T-Rex: "THE DANGERS OF HOME rule: why don't you hand me a note from you?"

T-Rex: It's a pun suggesting a hypothetical situation in which I would find quite attractive. Ooh! Or would I?  I find that offer rather amusing, as long as I don't make fun of it!
Dromiceiomimus: Is it a good joke?
T-Rex: It's funny, Dromiceiomimus! It's MADERGATE.

Utahraptor: Do you think that could be funny, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I don't think so!

T-Rex: At least, I think it would be funny.  I don't think that could be funny.  I think it would be funny BATMAN.
Utahraptor: It's a good joke, T-Rex. It's a good joke.
T-Rex: It's a good joke, Utahraptor. It's a good joke, Utahraptor.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Utahraptor, come overkick me for a spineless breakfast enjoyably named "Quis custodiet!"
Utahraptor: This is a good joke, T-Rex! It's a good joke!
T-Rex: Really? You don't like it?
Utahraptor: I do, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Yep!
Utahraptor: Does this mean I can't get your child's to sing "Let it be"?

T-Rex: Yes, as soon as I can.
