Devil: GREETINGS T-REX HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO PRODUCE YOUR OWN VIDEO GAME
T-Rex: Yep! Then I found out that it's really hard to make an imaginary horse jump inside a computer!!

T-Rex: Thanks, John Computers! Way to invent machines that don't even do what I want them to!!

T-Rex: There's all these programming languages but there's not one - NOT ONE - that  lets you type in "U r a horse and u can shoot bullets from the eyes. NOT A DREAM. There r bad guys 2 shoot and u can get powerups that make you shoot cannonballs from the hooves." and then a game comes out!
T-Rex: It's like - did we get bored half-way through inventing programming languages?? Why isn't this DONE yet??

Utahraptor: Well, come on, you'd need more of a description than that!
T-Rex: NOT A PROBLEM.

T-Rex: "Enemies are like what if you smashed Mario and Sonic together. But the bosses r giant and u shoot them even tho u r small (like in religion??)".
Utahraptor: I don't -
T-Rex: GAME PLEASE.

Devil: T-REX I WAS ASKING BECAUSE I NEED A PARTNER FOR MY COMPUTER GAME PROJECT
T-Rex: Well, what's it like?
Devil: I CALL IT "PRESS X TO EAT A PIE"
T-Rex: ...I'm listening...
Devil: YOUR NAME WILL BE "PRESS X TO EAT A PIE"
