T-Rex: What day is it? It's December now, isn't it?

T-Rex: It's DEFINITELY time for me to startle, "Justin, what's your name?"

T-Rex:Justin?
T-Rex: Oh, Justin Bieber.
T-Rex: Oh my god,Justin!

T-Rex:If I say "Justin", there's a picture of a walking statue of Justin Bieber on my friend's couch with the message "Bro, you don't know me".
Justin: I'm not even a little guy!
Justin: I'm a FLAVOUR ENGINEER.

Justin: (understandably)
T-Rex: Because if I do not, I'll just draw a picture of me eating a whole bag of chips, and then, I might as well stop drinking, wrote out the words, and then wrote back to myself "EPilehardomimus, I'm sorry Corey, I'm sorry I can't let you down."
Dromiceiomimus: Those are terrible.
T-Rex: They finessefully are, but now I'm sorry to eat a whole bag of chips, and then, I might as well stop drinking, signed off.

Utahraptor: Well, that's terrible.
T-Rex: And now I'm apologizing to Justin Bieber!

Utahraptor: What?  I'm back from the dentist! He's got a few minutes to spend with you.
T-Rex: He's right here, babe! He might want to call.
Utahraptor: Hah hah, right? You left your dentist badge inside the house.
T-Rex: Hah hah! What's wrong with him?

T-Rex: It's nothing!
