Narrator: T-REX AS: "THE COMPUTER SCIENTIST"

T-Rex: You go in circles with your eyes closed, Zen. You Zen around with your brain working to the best of its ability. You're, like, super good at computers. But the biggest problem I have with computers is how they're so dumb!

T-Rex: Hey, remember when Dromiceiomimus first noticed how my brain was so different than that of a regular computer?
Dromiceiomimus: That was while we were playing some games on her computer.
T-Rex: I had to be on my toes when I said that!!

Utahraptor: And now, we have to share this unusual and wonderful fact with you!
T-Rex: Yes!

Utahraptor: And now we can play some games on her old or new computer!
T-Rex: Yes we can!
Utahraptor: Okay, you're not allowed to run things on your old or new computer!

T-Rex: So all these games are being played, and now I'm not allowed to tell you what they are, because it's personal!
T-Rex: What? That's not what slot machine is about!
