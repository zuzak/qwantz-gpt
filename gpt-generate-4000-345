T-Rex: Wow! The plants are nice and the birds are singing and the sun is almost down from the top of the sky.

T-Rex: What a beautiful day!

Dromiceiomimus: But T-Rex, what if beauty is nothing but an illusion? What if we're all nothing but dreams within dreams that, for an instant, imagine themselves to be real?
T-Rex:
T-Rex: Yes! Let's go visit Dinosaur Park!
Dromiceiomimus: That's a good idea! I'll come with you.
T-Rex: Dinosaur Park!

Utahraptor: Where are you taking me?
T-Rex: Not from any park!

T-Rex: I was just thinking how great it would be to go to Dinosaur Park, if you wanted to see some dinosaur food.
Utahraptor: Hah!  I get it! You want to see dinosaurs that are REAL.
T-Rex: That's cool!
Narrator: THE END
