T-Rex: You know what they say: you can't take it with you!  You can't always get what you want!  You can't teach an old dog new tricks!  But you can't apologize to a lost friend!  You've got to be honest with a stranger, apologizing for something you didn't consciously choose to do.

Narrator: AN APOLOGY TO COMICS
Narrator: something you express with humor only

T-Rex: Sometimes you have to take out your anger, and sometimes you don't!  Sometimes you have to take out your anger, and sometimes you don't.  Sometimes you have to take out your anger, and sometimes you don't?
Dromiceiomimus: Man!  I've always seen it as your "1st" added insult.
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: It's gotta be pretty memorable though!

Utahraptor: What if you spent your life preparing for your punchline?
T-Rex: Oh, whatever!

Utahraptor: If you punch something that's REALLY hard, like a really long bread, and then you eat it, I'm not sure what you'd do.  But if you punch something that's easy, like a pizza, and then you eat it, I'm not sure what you'd do.  Maybe you'd try something new!
T-Rex: Or you could try pouring out of an old mug some cold punch!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Maaaaaan do I know what you're thinking about!
Narrator: finito
