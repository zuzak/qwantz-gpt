T-Rex:  Hello!  It's me, T-Rex, and you're wondering what the world would be like if everyone of us were dead.  Only, that doesn't include me.

T-Rex:  Not only would I be dead, but all my skills at crime would be extinct too!

Dromiceiomimus:  That's a pretty sad list, T-Rex!  Certainly a classy one!
T-Rex:  I think you're being too strict with your art!

Utahraptor:  What sort of skills would be extinct?
T-Rex:  As in, what skills would be extinct the dinosaurs would have none!

Utahraptor:  Oh, you want to know the answer to your question!
T-Rex:  I do.  Indeed, I did.
Utahraptor:  Ah.

Narrator:  LATER, THE FANTASTIC FOUR:
T-Rex: contact: lost soul T-Rex!
T-Rex:  I'M WITH THE FUTURE!
