T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! Oh MAN.  I'll never, ever get to do science fiction again.

T-Rex: I'd better get my ice cream ways snapped, because: "MAMMOTHASIS"!!

T-Rex: Not only would I not get to suck all over the things that are unfamiliar to modern consumers, but I wouldn't even be able to learn my craft! There's just too much innovation and freedom in each new product and process. I'd have to find a WHELM I grow up with, twist it around so it can swim away, and then add on more ingredients.

Utahraptor: Ice cream?
T-Rex: Not a problem, Utahraptor!

T-Rex: For breakfast. I plant my fruit in the center of my refrigerator, and then I freeze the fruit there. There's nothing else to do there. Still, I'd have to be prepared.
Utahraptor: Those are all fantasies! Not what you want to spend time about!

T-Rex: Yep! I know! I woke up this morning convinced I should just buy a new sweater, so that I could do experiments to see if my existing one actually works.
Utahraptor (off-panel): That's stupid, and I'm not even certain if it IS a stupid decision.
T-Rex: Well, at least it was a good decision.
