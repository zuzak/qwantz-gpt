T-Rex: I feel that I know what's best for me.  Time to create my own brand of celebrity!

T-Rex: Right!  So go ahead, try to be the best at zergling androids and stuff.

T-Rex: But don't be dumb!  Some of these things you're born know you'll change when you get married.  Some you're grown men orgirlfriends!
Dromiceiomimus: Man, I already know!
T-Rex: Got it.  You're already PRET-PLACED with this stuff.  You should be getting Bics right now.

T-Rex: S/he's different!  Some of these things are now part of who me is.
Utahraptor: I agree!  Sometimes, even the brands you see are years away!

T-Rex: Well, I guess we'll see about that!  For now!  I'm just continuing to stare at the walls of life long enough and seeing what happens.  You know?
Utahraptor: I look forward to seeing what you've got!
T-Rex: I love seeing what you've got!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Dear Diary!  My new clothes are too awesome!
