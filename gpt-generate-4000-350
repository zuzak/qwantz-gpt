Narrator: DINOSAUR COMICS ASKS: IF YOU COULD LOSE ANY SENSE, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAD A PROBLEM, YOU WOULD YOU?

T-Rex: Well, if that's a real sense, you'd have to be down for it!

T-Rex: Not complaining, you little dude! Not caring about your sense of smell. Good cop, I'll tell you what I feel: a week of chemo. Good cop, I sat down and said "stomach pain" and basically 3 weeks of chemo.
T-Rex: I don't know if I can live without my sense of smell!
Utahraptor: You could!

Utahraptor: Yes, you could. You are surrounded by chemops, Utahraptor.
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I'm with myself! I'm here to stay!
Utahraptor: No problem!

T-Rex: Yep! Well, I guess I'm about to!
Narrator: BACK AT HOME...
T-Rex: How cold it is, my friend!
