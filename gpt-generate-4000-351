T-Rex: You know what'd be a big pain?  Translating all our many and varied laws into a new language.  And you know what'd be a pain, I PROMISE??

T-Rex: All I need is for MY laws to be translated into another language AND another language AND another language A third country to hear!

Dromiceiomimus: I'm serious, the translators of the many laws would be hard pressed to come up with a single one of me!  Especially if we have the added benefit of not knowing the entire English Bill of Rights.  But you know what'd be a problem?  Punished by law, at least!
T-Rex: Punished by law, at least!!

Utahraptor: Punished by law, right?
T-Rex: Right!!

T-Rex: Well, ah - PRETTY BORING.  So, there's only a handful of places where the full English is -
Utahraptor: - and they all take forever!
T-Rex: Man, no, it wouldn't be that big a pain.  I'd need translators in ALL OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHS.

God: I GUESS I HAD SOME BUSES
T-Rex: Had we had a good relationship before?
God: I GUESS I HAD SOME BUSES
