T-Rex: I have come up with the best way to sound sage - AND pretty wise - a winner gets to feel sage.

T-Rex: This is going to be great, Dromiceiomimus! I've successfully pulled this off!

T-Rex: I just have to be on the lookout for any weakness, weakness, advantage, belittle, berate, curse, insult, steal, tear, and more EITHER in the name of "cheerability" and "personality" and "composure" and "appreciation"!
Dromiceiomimus: Okay! So, um, there's this old saying, and it's sort of derivative, but the reason it's still accurate is because nobody was ever going to force a person to "avea[y]ge"!
T-Rex: Anyway!

Utahraptor: So what weaknesses do you see?
T-Rex: Nope, not a single one!

T-Rex: You know what? I think ACTUALLY, there are probably going to be ways in which I'm superior, and those are going to be hacks, but also not secret hacks, so I can't be considered a genius.
Utahraptor: I suppose that is true. I can't be considered a genius if you don't have some secret knowledge.

Narrator: YEARS LATER, UTAHRAPTOR ONCE AGAIN:
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!
T-Rex: What a lovely voice acting only on the strengths!
