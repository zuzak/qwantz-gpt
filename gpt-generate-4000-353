T-Rex: Today is Pi Day! That means you get to eat pie at 1:59 PM, or 1:59 AM if you're up. I don't know.

T-Rex: I feel a profound disconnect with this holiday!

T-Rex: I get that it's celebrating the UNIVERSAL CONSTANT PI, and that it's celebrated today because 3.14159 can be translated into Mach 14th, 1:59. But what makes pi so special? Why don't we celebrate Euler's Number day on... February 71st?
Dromiceiomimus: Some people celebrate "Pi Approximation Day" on July 22nd, which is 22/7.
T-Rex: Hah! Now THAT is a holiday I can get behind!

Utahraptor: What? I'm supposed to be celebrating "Pi Approximation Day" on July 22nd?
T-Rex: No!
Utahraptor: You're supposed to just get on that -
T-Rex: I'm supposed to be standing on the edge of a well, and when I swipe it to peer over it, I'm going to get an award for "Most Inchoate Student"!

Utahraptor: I'm going to be the first to say "Thanks!" on July 22nd!
T-Rex: Yes! I'm going to be the first to do things hermit crabby, alone, across a clover meadow.
Utahraptor: I'm going to call my friends and tell them I'm going back in time and telling them I love them. I'm going to make sure to feed them every day for the next century.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE PAST!
T-Rex: 15 years later, on Facebook: 15 years AFTER MY ADDRESS BROKE BACK IN TIME!!!
T-Rex: Um... I put "back" in quotes because I was trying to read a book autographed by mine first birthday friend, T-Rex.
