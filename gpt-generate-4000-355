T-Rex: The problem with Valentine's Day is that, if you get your sweetie chocolates, the sweetness of the gesture is tainted with some measure of Societal Expectation!

T-Rex: That's the problem with Valentine's Day!

T-Rex: And that's all I have to say on the subject!!

Utahraptor: T-Rex!
Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex!
T-Rex: WHAT?

Utahraptor: I got you a chocolate
Utahraptor: "Choco" card, yes.
Utahraptor: Yes. See the one with the text "I AGREE"!

T-Rex: That's it! I got you a chocolate. COST. When you see that, pour your chocolate chips into the heat, and then place the chips on your plate!
Utahraptor: That's still money! I took napa!

T-Rex: SUCKS.
