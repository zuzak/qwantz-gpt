T-Rex: God, you know those dreams where you're about to have an exam and you haven't studied at all?
God: YEPPERS
T-Rex: What's the DEAL?

T-Rex: And how come bad things happen to nice people?!
God: UH

T-Rex: And how come everything I do can have such a big effect on the future, but I have no idea of what effect I'm having, and whether or not I'm a positive influence? And how come not everyone gets to live to old age? And how come there's diseases like Alzheimer's for when I get one?
God: SEE THE THING THERE IS
T-Rex: Oh, hold on, I think it's bubbly your floor!
God: KAY

Utahraptor: bubbly just as I got that ghost thing!
T-Rex: What ghost, Utahraptor?

Utahraptor: Yeah, the thing with ghosts: they're unpredictable and hard to predict. I can't predict it either.
T-Rex: Well, I CAN predict the ghost of tomorrow, and that's me, for us time. We'll all go and get some, Utahraptor.

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: I just can't figure out what the ghost of today is or what the ghost of yesterday is.
Utahraptor: Huh.
T-Rex: It's hard to tell, because I've never been.
Utahraptor: Yeah, I got this one.
T-Rex: I get it - two ghosts for I guess.
Utahraptor: Ghosts sometimes have children.

T-Rex: "Happy"?
