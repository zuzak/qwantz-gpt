T-Rex: For example, you could chop down trees with a spear!

T-Rex: You were more than six!
Utahraptor: Sure!

T-Rex: But not all of the conveniences you had were cut!
Utahraptor: So?
Utahraptor: So you hunted with your spear!
Utahraptor: No, but you were responsible for killing some.

T-Rex: Shoot some, I guess!
T-Rex: Shoot some, I guess!
