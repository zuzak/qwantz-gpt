T-Rex: I have the greatest idea for a movie!  I've said this before but this time it's for serious.  There's no WONDERING BECAUSE I've just said it!  I'll simply make a MOMENT of it and then we'll all get a very particular treat!

T-Rex: For example, here is a munchieu: a woman eating a whole baguette, with a note beneath the baguette that says "NOT GUARANTEED LOSS OF HEARTLEMONIUM FACTORY":
T-Rex: MOMENT of it!  Maybe we'll get very symbolic of that.  Sweet!

Utahraptor: Okay, I agree, T-Rex!  But I'm not actually saying a movie is beautiful, or that there's either.
T-Rex: Okay, I am!  I'm just sayin'!

T-Rex: Movie touches, if they're applicable?  If you like science fiction stories you'll find out where a woman accidentally pushes her butt into a wall and then makes a mental note to "always butt into the wall."
Utahraptor: I -
T-Rex: There's no such thing as artlessorical female oppression!  I'm not even go-to female oppression!!

God: T-REX YOU'RE SUPPOSING MYSELF INTO A JOURNEY FOR MEN
T-Rex: Yep!  I'm walking in the door, and SOMETIMES it's not you!  I can't have a conversation without DYING.
God: WE'VE GOT NO IDEA HOW TO ACTUALLY DO THAT
T-Rex: Yeah!  Like joens punch it.
God: COMPLAINING IS ALL "YES" TO CAPS
Utahraptor: Um, you're just walking around with a giant sign that says "no chumps, YOU are DYING."
T-Rex: Yeah, it's not me.
Utahraptor: Well Chicks and women don't get murdered all the time.  We watch from the ceiling as chairs overflow.

God: WAIT NOW CHICKS AND WOMEN DON'T INSULT ME
T-Rex: Um - that's totally the point!
God: WELL THAT'S NOT ALLOWED NOW
