T-Rex: Hey, who wants to party? I woke up and I said "I want to party!" and then I gasped because it was BONA FIDE FACTS.

T-Rex: Is this TRULY the day when everyone else wants to party as well?

T-Rex: Hey Dromiceiomimus - wanna party??
Dromiceiomimus: I can't, T-Rex! I've got a dentist appointment.
T-Rex: We can party afterwards!
Dromiceiomimus: Depends on how it goes at the dentist, I think. I don't want to party with new fillings.

Narrator: A FEW MINUTES LATER...
Utahraptor: T-Rex! We're having a party!!
T-Rex: No, man!

T-Rex: Why the long face? I thought it was toasty!
Utahraptor: Well, I think you should party! It's long been my tradition to go out and have a good time, and you're expecting me to rush out and buy your drink.
T-Rex: Aha, my drinking and eating ways are not yet clear!

Narrator: STILL NO, THIS IS NOT AN ADVENTURE BUT A DRINK WITH FRIGGIN' SCROWD GLUTEN in it:
T-Rex: Aah, if this party goes poorly it means I've had too much of your delicious drink!
T-Rex: AHHHHHH
