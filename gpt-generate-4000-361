Narrator: GREGOR MACGREGOR COMICS
T-Rex: That name is totally made up. It was made up by a Scottish Enthusiast.
T-Rex: I'm just sayin'.

T-Rex: Anyway, Gregor MacGregor was this explorer guy in the 1800s!

T-Rex: In 1820 he sailed from the Mosquito Coast of Central America to England, with the news that one of the native kings there had given him 30,000 km2 of land! The land was incredibly fertile, the natives helpful, and he'd already established an army, banks, civil service AND democracy there. You couldn't walk without tripping on the gold nuggets that littered the ground, and MacGregor was selling land grants at a very reasonable rate!!

Utahraptor: You're describing the FICTIONAL nation of Poyais, T-Rex! That was a huge scam!
T-Rex: It - what?

Utahraptor: When the colony boats arrived, instead of opera houses they found untamed jungle, tropical disease and venomous snakes. One settler even committed suicide after trading his life savings for passage. By the time a rescue boat was sent and returned to London, 180 of the 240 emigrants had DIED.

God: SEE T-REX THIS IS WHY I KEEP SAYING YOU SHOULD FINISH YOUR BOOKS BEFORE TELLING YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT THEM
T-Rex: It wasn't a book!!
T-Rex: It was a WIKIPEDIA PAGE that got BORING half-way through.
