T-Rex: Would the dude who is TRULY sick please raise the roof?

T-Rex: OH WAIT.  It's me!  Renewed from the hospital!

T-Rex: And I'll show you how!  Renew: way!  Renest Hodor!  Renest!  Renest RHYME!
Dromiceiomimus: Would you also enjoy a nice breakfast, T-Rex?
T-Rex: YES!  Would I?  I would!  And if you are still in hospital, then go home and recover!

Utahraptor: Did you know that in the hospital there is a big sign that says "Broke"!
T-Rex: Aaaaaand there's a picture of me in a really bad mood!

T-Rex: I thought maybe there's something wrong with the pictures, okay? Maybe they just caused it?
Utahraptor: Maybe they're Photoshopped?
T-Rex: No, okay.  Maybe something's wrong with the pictures.  And you don't want to comment on that?  Fine!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE HOSPITAL:
T-Rex: Five rad cuts on my body!
T-Rex: One of them is extending out from my belly button to my stomach.  One of it is going inside your chest.
T-Rex: Five rad cuts on my body.
