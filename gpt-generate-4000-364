Narrator: T-REX VISITS A GHOST TOWN.
T-Rex: Attention, any ghosts that can hear me! I have one thing to say to you:

T-Rex: this is awesome

Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex!
T-Rex: What's up?

Utahraptor: Nothing memorable happened, T-Rex! All you did was tour around the ghost town and find out more!
T-Rex: Was it great to be back in town again real quick?
Utahraptor: It was a lot of fun, actually!

Narrator: A FEW HOURS LATER:
T-Rex: Excuse me, sir, you look down! The sun's just barely above my head!
T-Rex: You should be, you can face me... face to face!
