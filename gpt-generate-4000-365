T-Rex: Zombies! Everyone loves zombies. They are a window onto the Other! They let us face our fears of society in a way that is accessible and compelling, as well as accessibly and compellingly cannibalistic!

God: HEY T-REX CAN YOU SUMMARIZE THAT IN ONE SENTENCE FOR ME
T-Rex: T-Rex loves zombies!

T-Rex: I think what I love best about them is when they're used to represent mindless, often brutalized behaviour. For example, if you think of a ZOMBIE CATTLE ROBOT as a hairy, heavily-armoured robot with a human head mounted display (HED) and some cardboard cutouts of other robots!
Dromiceiomimus: That's your "robots" versus humans dichotomy!
T-Rex: Just match the robots' description of the behaviour of the humans with the robots' descriptions of the robots. That's your "human-robots" debate.

Utahraptor: You think cut-rate, multi-lingual robot analogies are the best?
T-Rex: Well, I guess we're done here, T-Rex!

T-Rex: Because if it's as good as some of my human-robots talks be telling me to, I'll take it!
Utahraptor: If it's as good as representing cut-rate, multi-lingual beatification as bad, I'm in trouble. I've bet the quality of my talk has dropped by the wayside.
T-Rex: I'm doing it. Cut-rate, multi-lingual beatification: I've got one more thing to do!

T-Rex: So! Who here wants to do what I do?
Utahraptor: The answer is no-one!
T-Rex: But we're in the Land of the Free, otherwise known as 2000K+ people!
Utahraptor: Let's do it!
T-Rex: Let's have our own words!
Utahraptor: Our own languages!
T-Rex: And burn that English first, so we can talk of food as if it's the first, best, and the bestest thing ever!
