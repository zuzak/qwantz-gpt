T-Rex: I have been compiling a list that I think might be of value!
God: WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE PLAINS
T-Rex: They're heavy horses!

T-Rex: So if you're wondering why the hills are empty, then I think you're asking too much! I also think you asking is asking a question. In this case, the answer is -
Utahraptor: - it's full of hills.

Utahraptor: If you don't want to get in trouble, then don't get in trouble now. There's horses all around!
T-Rex: No problem!
Utahraptor: Don't get shot down!
T-Rex: Get - bitches don't get bitches!
Utahraptor: Get beat up!
Utahraptor: The intersection of law and art is not a straight line!

T-Rex: That's what I'm saying! Don't get shot down, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: Get - bitches don't get bitches!
Utahraptor: The intersection of law and art is not a straight line!
