T-Rex: I have finished a new book!  It is called, "Breaking the Habitable Phase: Why We Got So Flabbergastingly Orphaned."

T-Rex: It details the sex lives of orphan children in the sex trade!

T-Rex: And I have included in my book a lot of naked pictures of babies!
T-Rex: And one of the children is so sexy that when she's aged five, she'll go on to seduce the next child!
T-Rex: The book gets better over time!

Utahraptor: I can't believe we're doing this.  You've got to.
T-Rex: I've done it to steal a book!!

T-Rex: But I've also done it to give the next kid the chance to an untrained eye!
Utahraptor: chapter two.
T-Rex: HELL YEAH!  I THINK IT'S GREAT!  I THINK THE PAST CHIP GOT A GREAT PROBLEM.

T-Rex: I call my book "An Inconceivable Tale of Why We Got So Flabbergastingly Orphaned."
