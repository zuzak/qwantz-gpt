T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for talking about my life and friends!

Narrator: Today is the day!
T-Rex: Today is the day for getting opinions from strangers!

T-Rex: This is a great day for getting opinions from Adults!
Dromiceiomimus: Adults in the situation you're living in?  Adults that YOU'RE about to, Dromiceiomimus.  Adults that suggest we get together and drink some cola-flavoured beer, before weNARRATIVE PARTY.
T-Rex: It's a great day for getting opinions from Adults!

Utahraptor: So what's your build?
T-Rex: My house, that is!

T-Rex: Ha ha, that was pretty much all I had to say, actually.  But before you say anything, I've added a line that says "WE DON'T ALL LIKE TO SLEEP IN COURT"; obviously angry, but also in good fun.
Utahraptor: "We don't like to do that."?
T-Rex: Not in your house, dude.

T-Rex: And?
Utahraptor: Oh, that's still good.  But I've made a big mistake.
T-Rex: I'm going to go talk to the adults here.  Okay?
Utahraptor: "I think we can both fine-tune that, if one of us is here."
T-Rex: Those are the sorts of conversations I'm talking about.
