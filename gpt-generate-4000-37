Narrator: WHY YOU GOTTA BE SO SOVABLE AT ENGLISH

T-Rex: You're saying it like it's the #1 favourite language? Why not spell it out for us and try again?
Dromiceiomimus: Because it's the #1 favourite English!
T-Rex: WELL WE'D JUST KEEP USING THEM.
Dromiceiomimus: You only like English because it's hard to write!
T-Rex: WHAT.

T-Rex: Well, ladies, that hasn't stopped me from still being that way for some time. I even like Catalan for that matter.
Utahraptor: Irish for "meh", German for "uh", and Swiss for "i".

T-Rex: Darren I'm sorry English, but!
T-Rex: I'm sorry English!
