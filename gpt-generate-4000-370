T-Rex: If I ever build an office building, I'll have room 403 have a lock on its door, and then it'll go straight to room 405.

T-Rex: Room 404 and room 405 are clearly referred to as "Sloppy Covered Conveyions"

T-Rex: And if I ever learn about controlled substances, I'll have room 459 in the room with the smoke clearly visible, and then it's room 404 with the woman clearly visible.
Dromiceiomimus: What about the Columbian tragedy, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Probably?

T-Rex: ...Room 501?
Utahraptor: 416, room 459.
T-Rex: 416, room 459.

T-Rex: 416, room 501.
Utahraptor: ...I dunno.
T-Rex: It's really hard to design small-town decay analogies, especially when you consider how analogously bad the Columbian tragedy was!

T-Rex: And that's what this conversation is about, anyway!
T-Rex: Alright! Find room 404 in the Columbian tragedy and say "I don't understand."
T-Rex: Room 404 doesn't understand!
T-Rex: It's a cold, dead hearted death.
