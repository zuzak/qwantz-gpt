T-Rex: I am in the prime of life! Therefore, I must commit myself to continually improving myself.

T-Rex: Time for me to eat fewer fast food and to eat fewer vegetables!

T-Rex: In the same timeframe I would need to eat less jerk sandwiches!
Dromiceiomimus: Well, T-Rex, there's no reason to eat more jerk sandwiches than other people are actually eating!
T-Rex: True!

T-Rex: However, I could of course eat fewer!
Utahraptor: Less! Why not?

T-Rex: I am starting a new phrase: "Fewer jokes, less likable personality, and a decreased chance of being a cool, confident person!"
Utahraptor: That's not bad!
T-Rex: IT'S BAD, huh?

T-Rex: BUT, it's kinda better than "less jerk sandwiches"!
