T-Rex: I just got an email invitation from "Sherlock Holmes and the Chamber of Secrets"! Mystery solved!

T-Rex: Plus I got a sweet story on my door!

T-Rex: What started out as a joke turned into a real life crisis! I'd like to be a better friend, and I'd also like to be a better friend, Dromiceiomimus. And if you find humour distasteful, call them to account!
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex?
T-Rex: An' I'm serious! If I don't laugh at them, they'll burn me!

Utahraptor: So you think there's no room for comedy in the afterlife, right?
T-Rex: No room!

T-Rex: Because the afterlife is real, and there's jokes too! Comedy's the natural response to a situation of universal fundamental boredom!
Utahraptor: Ah, the days of awkward back-and-forth between dead people are over, T-Rex.
T-Rex: SHIT! How the hell did I know that?

T-Rex: I was a little kid, trying to figure out comedy. By doing, I learned how to draw!
T-Rex: BY LAYING ON PEOPLE, AND HOW TO MAKE THEM LOL!
