T-Rex: God, you know those dreams where you're about to have an exam and you haven't studied at all?
God: YEPPERS
T-Rex: What's the DEAL?

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: HEY! MY BODY
Dromiceiomimus: WHO'S THE DECKNER?
T-Rex: Apparently he's so great I can hardly believe he's not laughing.

T-Rex: I was seriously trying to pick up English when I was a child!
Utahraptor: Who's the giggly one?
T-Rex: Apparently he's not laughing!

T-Rex: Sorry! He's chuckly, so he's standing right now, and he's - well, he's clearly a genius.
Utahraptor: Oh.  Looks like he's -
T-Rex: HE'S JUST WALKING DOWN THE STREET.

T-Rex: I can't believe it!
T-Rex: I'll tell him you said that you were chuckly, but also I told him I was a genius, and I said I'd show him the school clock.
T-Rex: 4:30 PM!
