T-Rex: The number of atoms in my body is probably around 6 x 10^29.  That's a 6 followed by 29 zeroes.

T-Rex: Guys!
T-Rex: That's an awful lot of friggin' atoms!

T-Rex: But to compare, the number of atoms in the universe is EVEN MORE.  Let's lowball it and it's at least 10^80: that's one followed by eighty zeroes!  And that means that the percentage of the atoms in the universe that's ALL ME is... zero point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero  zero  zero  zero  zero  zero
