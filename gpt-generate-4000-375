T-Rex: I am a guy who just plain loves cookies. And I do not need a PhD in logistic dynamics to tell me that!

T-Rex: My brooding, worried, worried voice is totally going to drown out the friggin' birds.

T-Rex: I have just the thing!  I have a secret!  The bird it's watching is oblivious to my sudden and disturbing interest!  The only effect on the world will be the temporary disappearance of Christmas!
Dromiceiomimus: Is the ghost of Christmas watching us?
T-Rex: Yes.  It is a horrible thing to witness, to ponder!

Utahraptor: I think it's really unsettling to believe such things,istant from your own obsolescence!
T-Rex: I know!

T-Rex: It makes me worry that if I do, my own products line up and  will be way better than those of my neighbour.
Utahraptor: Could this problem be solved with Christmas-centric innovation?
T-Rex: I will!  It's a good idea!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: I'm looking forward to a gooey feeling beneath your feet!
