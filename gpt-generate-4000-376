T-Rex: So, I've laid down the rules for new roads and roads!  I'm a man riding his bike on an empty air-conditioned field.

T-Rex: And I'M just the one who came up with the idea!

T-Rex: And I'm jammin'!  I need a RATE of EXPLOSIONS.
Dromiceiomimus: What's a good breakup?
T-Rex: Oh, I don't know.  "Ohhhhh!"
T-Rex: "SSS."

T-Rex: "SSHHH."
Utahraptor: These are the sorts of words that most people who relapse, ACTUALLY, into swear.

T-Rex: Well, I don't get them.  They're the sort of word that comes out of a guy's mouth only two hours a week.  And they're also the ones that, trite as they may sounds, are THE SYNTHESIZED, the guy who says the word "lactose intolerant" and who walks around with a walker in his head.

T-Rex: Um, that's what I meant!  Also, this is an example of the "set up" not the "in".
T-Rex: It's just - I don't get them.  It occurs to me that a given word can have more than one meaning, even if I'm just summarizing one moment of my life!
T-Rex: They taste like gumpert gumpert gumpert
