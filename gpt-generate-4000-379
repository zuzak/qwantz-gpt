Narrator: COMICS THAT END IN "OH SHIIII-"
T-Rex: Wow!  My bed is now "My wet bed".

Narrator: TALKING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S COUCHES
T-Rex: Man, you just can't get enough!

T-Rex: Talking about other people's couches can be a freeing experience!  Freeing your eyes from their decoration, using them only in times of need, and, DO: Not often!
Utahraptor: What about using someone else's couch?

T-Rex: What about that?
Utahraptor: Yes, that is an awful thing to say!  When someone says "no" to you, don't just sign "No"!!  Do what you're told, and get the heck out of here!
T-Rex: "What do you mean?"
Utahraptor: "You cannot describe what it is to be totally alone in a room."

T-Rex: "Total freedom?"
