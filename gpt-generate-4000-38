Narrator: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW
T-Rex: We detect evidence of alien life tomorrow: a signal from a distant solar system. It starts out simple: numbers, counting, that sort of thing!

T-Rex: And then it starts to get more advanced, encoding mathematics!

T-Rex: And then: instructions for decoding images that are about to be transmitted. In a few months we go from hoping we're not alone to knowing that intelligent life is out there, and they're about to show us what they look like!
Dromiceiomimus: And what do they look like?
T-Rex: WHO KNOWS?
T-Rex: We're at the very frontier of imagination here, Dromiceiomimus. Let's find out!

Utahraptor: But maybe they look like...puppies?
T-Rex: Utahraptor, please! NO WAY aliens look like puppies!

Utahraptor: If you go back millions of years, you can trace your grandparents out to the very edge of time and tell the exact age of their body NOW. That's what our universe offers.
T-Rex: But maybe, just maybe, they looked like we did!
Utahraptor: Let's find out if the distant universe is real or just an illusion created by us.
T-Rex: Please. Please tell me.
Utahraptor: It's just - sometimes, you wondered.

Utahraptor: If time travel worked, who knows which god would show up and tell us about it?
T-Rex: The Gods. They're in control of our universe now.
Utahraptor: But that's fine! It's their universe at all costs!
T-Rex: We Gods, we'll have to accept your lesser evil just as you are.

T-Rex: You're just a regular guy with a grudge!
Utahraptor: I'm not!
Utahraptor: I'm a regular guy who's had a grudge!
Utahraptor: Hah hah hah! What is it?
T-Rex: YOU ARE TEAMING UP WITH A GRANDMOTHER AND HER BIRTHY WING AND THERE'S NOT A HERMAPHROD IN BIRTH
