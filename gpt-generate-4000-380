T-Rex:  Hello and welcome to Super-Fan, the #1 talk show for fans of Superman!

T-Rex:  So we all know about the show, right?

T-Rex:  Superman is a guy who really loves Super Friends.  He really does.  So he really does.  But one day, he goes out with a female friend and they go to a bar.  One time a woman asks him if she can get a drink for her, and Superman says she's too, and then he starts getting jealous.  Then he gets very jealous.  Why?  Because he's been trying to get HER drink for like two years.

Utahraptor:  Then what happens?
T-Rex:  And then Superman becomes sad?

T-Rex:  And then he starts getting pretty angry at her for not showing up for his party the night before!  And then, like all the women in the show, he gets drunk!
Utahraptor:  That's the end of the world?
T-Rex:  We get to end the show!

T-Rex:  The women in the show become the show's Sadistic Professor, Professor Death... why don't you just shift the characters to happy endings?
Utahraptor:  That would be too depressing.
T-Rex:  Yes!  I think that would be a really nice change of pace, and allow for some of the darker elements in the story.

T-Rex:  Yes indeed! The women in the show become the characters of the story: the damsel in a lurid tale that isn't about them, that's just a super sad story about them.  Oh snap!
T-Rex:  What's she doing?
T-Rex:  I don't know!
