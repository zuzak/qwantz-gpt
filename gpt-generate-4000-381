T-Rex: I've been thinking about time travel lately!
God: YOU THINK ABOUT TIME TRAVEL CONSTANTLY

T-Rex: That's true; I AM pretty great!

T-Rex: In fact, I'll go back in time to do the same thing with my friends: remind them of my good times! Something that I'll be TIMELESS and disappointing and then maybe I'll make a big list!
Dromiceiomimus: Then you'd best get ready to be screwed for the rest of your life!
T-Rex: What? I already got screwed!

Utahraptor: I get the appeal of this, T-Rex! Why don't you do it all over the world?
T-Rex: Nuh-uh! Why don't you go and do it all over the world? AND, Dromiceiomimus, why do you keep sending ME back in time?
Utahraptor: I don't know. I think you've got problems with the Universe again!

Narrator: THAT NIGHT, IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE:
T-Rex: Ladies and gentlemen: I've got some regrets!
T-Rex: I keep it pretty conservative when I'm sending to/from my friends AND/OR hispanic heritage sites.
