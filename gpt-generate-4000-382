T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!

T-Rex: I will consider it as a public service!

T-Rex: To begin: my house is too small and I am apt to root (eat) fewer crops!
Dromiceiomimus: My yard is narrow and I am apt to poo?!
T-Rex: What? My yard is only one room from cronyism and corruption is at best a cliche excuse and at worst a crime.

Utahraptor: I find my politics are more in accordance with the mold of a late dictator
T-Rex: What?

Utahraptor: Well, to be fair, that's where I'm coming from.
T-Rex: That's because I am unabashed in my ability to cringe upon those who disagree with me!
Utahraptor: Ha ha! Whatevs!

T-Rex: I cringe the same!
T-Rex: For you see, I am (absent any irony) a fan-of-the-books guy from my history class!
