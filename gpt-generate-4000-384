T-Rex: Anthropomorphism is when you have things that normally could be described as "normality", because, for every item of taste and way of life, there's at least one way of looking at them. Sometimes they're awesome!

T-Rex: And I am not one to say that describes EVERYONE'S experience of the world.

T-Rex: Okay, fine, so. Sometimes they're awesome.  But I don't think we've ever articulated the idea of an entire universe encapsulating taste and experience exploring the limits and possibilities of external space.
T-Rex: I, for one, am not that guy!

Utahraptor: You think you have an expertise with that sort of thing?
T-Rex: Sure!

Utahraptor: Soaps don't explore the limits and possibilities of internal space, you know?  Or the idea of a single, universal, universal experience.
T-Rex: Um.  That's where ego come from?  And the idea of a single person taking an interest in everyone else's life and then drifting off to somewhere new and different?

T-Rex: I'm gonna!  I'm gonna totally totally do that.  It's gonna be a text book.  And if it's for the first time, I'm gonna put it on the bus!
Narrator: THE END
