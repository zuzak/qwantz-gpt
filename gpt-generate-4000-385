T-Rex: Hey, Utahraptor, is your house on a hot day?
T-Rex: Nice!

T-Rex: I think it's time for us to toast a few different things to get a better picture!

Narrator: HOW'S YOUR HOUSE WALKING TODAY?
T-Rex: Um... really really REALLY STICKED?
T-Rex: 5'8" and under

T-Rex: My new house is all solid... Dromiceiomimus
Dromiceiomimus: looks like you've got a hole in your house, T-Rex! Also, how big is your dog?
T-Rex: I gotta say, I'm not complaining

Narrator: THE END
