T-Rex: I have the greatest idea for a movie!  I've said this before but this time it's for serious.  There's this cop, right?
T-Rex: Right!

T-Rex: And he's a "by-the-books" cop who does everything "by-the-books".
T-Rex: But there's more to it than that!
T-Rex: The cop is a "by-the-books" person who does everything "by-the-books".
T-Rex: But in another universe, he's a "by-the-books"!  A "by-the-books"!

T-Rex: So if we all read his script we'll have a story about a man who "likes trees", and a sequel where he writes "LOVES VIDEO GAMES".
Utahraptor: I want my movie to have a story where the rules are explained in detail and the players reluctantly accept that fantasy!

T-Rex: Yes!  This is the ultimate secret revenge movie!
Utahraptor: For real?
T-Rex: What if I don't like my movie the first time?
Utahraptor: Then the next time you do it, T-Rex will slap you on the wrist for the first time?
T-Rex: You're go!

T-Rex: "The players play the game, then they take turns hitting your head or fists."
T-Rex: "The cameras pan back and forth, looking for laughs. Eventually the greatest hits the fan."
