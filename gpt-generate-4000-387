Narrator: THE MOVING COMIC
T-Rex: I have a friend...

T-Rex: Let's call him "Ryan!"

T-Rex: Anyway, Ryan moved to a new city this weekend. He loaded up all his books into his car, but when he arrived they were soaked!
T-Rex: Ruined.
T-Rex: PULP.

T-Rex: I understand he was pretty upset about this.
Utahraptor: Oh well!

T-Rex: Well, that's not very supportive!
Utahraptor: Hey, I know this guy! The books are in great hands, and I won't be stomping on these old books in the same manner.

T-Rex: But will they not also not be in great hands that were soaked in rubbing alcohol before you bought them, and then rubbed with alcohol-based finishing oils?
Utahraptor: I guess!
T-Rex: I'll be fair, I promise it!
