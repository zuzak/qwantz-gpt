T-Rex: You know what I'm tired of feeling?
God: EMOTIONS
T-Rex: (Emotions are cool though!)

T-Rex: (I love emotions!)

T-Rex: How are we, Deinococcus radiodurans?  It was so cool growing up without sun and dirt on it!
Deinococcus radiodurans: Not cool, T-Rex!
T-Rex: That's why we're called...
T-Rex: ...Tsaraptor's Rottweilers.

Utahraptor: Yours is right, not a complaint!
T-Rex: Right.

Utahraptor: That's because we don't have sun and dirt, just bacteria and dirt.
T-Rex: Dirt?  That's bad.
Utahraptor: Yeah, that's kinda awesome!
Utahraptor: It's super nice to see friends again.

Narrator: BUT SECRETLY...!
T-Rex: What's that, a studio?
