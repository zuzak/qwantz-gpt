T-Rex: You know what I'm most impressed by when people say I've achieved at least a little change?  People are more likely to say "made the world a better place", or "made me a billionaire".

T-Rex: It's a good thing I haven't made any significant progress on that!

T-Rex: I think a good example is immigration.  My once great country of China is gone, and most of the world is gone too.  But what's left?  A woman who brought me in half a cup of tea and said "I feel the same way, and I've probably made a lot of progress"?
Dromiceiomimus: Well I'm left to wonder if you ever come up with the perfect solution to a problem!
T-Rex: Like what?

Utahraptor: Oh, I always imagined a world where people liked each other!  A world of occasional shocks, where surprise is the order of the day!
T-Rex: And home runs are left in the field, too often!
Utahraptor: Exactly!  The people who invented baseball had in mind a particular shade of gold, called "the rustlers".

T-Rex: Hark!  A world where everyone else likes to catch flies and fly thief from zeppelins and have them hang around forever is created, with everyone's favourite fly thief now a pariah!
T-Rex: And justice done!
