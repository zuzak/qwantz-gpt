T-Rex: I've come up with the best idea ever! Oh my goodness. Let's put up all sorts of stereotypes!

T-Rex: It's so easy!

Narrator: T-REX AND THE CREEPTURE OF ROBIN HOOD

T-Rex: Okay, so Robin Hood killed his dad and then his mom dumped him for a... $50?
Dromiceiomimus: What if they were baby gender-neutral pronouns?
T-Rex: I would love to use them, Dromiceiomimus.

Utahraptor: Who's trying to make this happen?
T-Rex: Not true! NOT!

Utahraptor: What if there was a way you could be heard but not actually saw?
T-Rex: That would be terrifying. I would love being able to hear you from restaurants, Utahraptor.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I actually just felt like saying this just ahead of time, but anyway, you guys. This is what I'm doing with my life now. Go do me.
T-Rex: No thanks! Now everything I say is being recorded.
