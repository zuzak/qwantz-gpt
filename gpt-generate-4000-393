T-Rex: I have come up with a perfect way not to believe in anything wrong ever again.  Evidentialism

T-Rex: A belief is justified only if there is sufficient evidence to support it!

T-Rex: Therefore, I won't believe in things like faith healing, because there's no room for faith in evidentialism!  I also don't believe in Christmas, which I understand is good because it's really sad.  Anyway!
T-Rex: I don't mean to be sad!
Utahraptor: Just want to be believed!

Utahraptor: Just like you, I'd love to believe you did in fact eighteen years ago today!  FINE.
T-Rex: EVEN BETTER NOT WORTH IT If I Was Ever There ANYmore!!

Narrator: BUT SOON:
T-Rex: There's no room for doubt in your heart of hearts!
