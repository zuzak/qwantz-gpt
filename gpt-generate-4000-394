T-Rex: In my new video game, you control a lady named "Mary Oh". She's of Chinese descent, which explains her awesome name! But her boyfriend has been kidnapped!

T-Rex: You and your half-sister Kay love to help them escape, but Mary is also kidnapped by aliens from the future! Only you and her boyfriend, Adina, are up to something!
Dromiceiomimus: Can you and Kay save the princess from the aliens?
T-Rex: Utah! Can you and Adina save the princess from the aliens?

Utahraptor: Can Adina save the princess from the aliens?
T-Rex: Yep!

Utahraptor: Can she save the princess from the aliens?
T-Rex: And yet, she still wants to be Mary Parker and wants her own name.
Utahraptor: This is no time for box ideas!
T-Rex: No, come on!! This is a time for reliving some old favourites!

T-Rex: Let's make a world where Mary and Nat are the rules of the road!
T-Rex: Let's do it!
