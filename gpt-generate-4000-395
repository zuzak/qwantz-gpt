T-Rex: Am I perhaps too comfortable, too satisfied with my life and friends and ROUTINE? Has the warm embrace of satisfaction become the smothering kiss of COMPLACENCY?

T-Rex: It's time for some changes, gentlemen!!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I am changing my life and outlook on life. I am selling myself short and moving to a new town, where I will take the less agreeable paths. Last week I boldly went places I never could've done, because I never knew I could do them.
Dromiceiomimus: Aww! That's sad.
T-Rex: It's totally true! I've decided that I will outlive my friends and have no idea what I could've done if I'd tried.

Utahraptor: But you're not crazy!
T-Rex: Absolutely not!

T-Rex: I tried building a supercomputer but it's like, OH, I don't know? What am I going to do? What am I going to do without the punchline?
Utahraptor: Man, I hear you!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE FUTURE!
T-Rex: Hello, Alexander Graham Bell! I'm glad you're here, as I think that what we do is quite great.
T-Rex: Glad to hear it!
