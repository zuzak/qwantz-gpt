T-Rex: It's possible that one day, an advanced civilization (and not necessarily our own!) might be able to reasonably simulate an entire universe, or at least fake it for simulated people living inside.

T-Rex: And this simulated people might be awesome, because they'd know how to make jokes and feel really funny, even though they might just be knowably terrible. It's a scary thought, Dromiceiomimus! I imagine people would find it really funny.
Dromiceiomimus: Okay!

Utahraptor: Would you say you'reability comes down to whether or not you believe in somebody someone: a very personal decision!
T-Rex: Sure!

Utahraptor: And this makes it even more impressive when you add up the strength of the human race against a totally hypothetical zeternaler, who'd have to give up a lot of their humanity for something more in common.
T-Rex: Sure! Maybe. But I'd ask -
Utahraptor: "What if there was a genetically engineered robot that was also super handsome, but also had sad face teeth?"

T-Rex: OH MY GOD they'd have to give up their humanity! I'd be all, "Robots: We Want That, We Can't T-Rex."
Utahraptor: "What if there was a robot that could not only save the human race, but was also super sexy, but also had a strict protein vision deficiency that made it totally unable to see irony??"
T-Rex: "What if there was a sentient sentient robot that could never have a child, because sad face teeth are the only protein the human eye can synthesize?"
