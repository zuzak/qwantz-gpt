T-Rex: "Antonio Tony and Amelia wake up in a world where suddenly everyone has gone blind!"

T-Rex: "It's a story straight out of the famous novel by David Plurrove!"

T-Rex: "It's a story about a guy who has a wish! He wishes he could be immortal, but he's turned his life and learned all he can!"
Dromiceiomimus: "So the only way he can be immortal is by drowning in a lake of water that he never enters!"
T-Rex: "The lake is beautiful, and he decides to go swimming. But the water is really boring, so he decides to run into some nice people."

Utahraptor: "Finally, he decides to become a god and become good at something... something... NOT good at GOD."
T-Rex: "He also becomes sad and gave in to the desires of the times and ended up becoming a monster."

T-Rex: "In conclusion, David Plurrove Plurrove was a really good guy! I hope we all get to hear more of his stories soon."
Utahraptor: "I always thought David was a kind and caring god!"
T-Rex: "He was a big lover and a good listener, but he also was a big snob and a very sassy bunch of people who never quite come together."

T-Rex: History! We've got to hear more of this story later!
Utahraptor: Hey, as not to overshadow what's happening in the world, here's a picture of me and Plurrove.
T-Rex: Later!
Utahraptor: Later and I believe they have a silent but cordial handshaking handsaw.
