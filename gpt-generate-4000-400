T-Rex: One day, the land on Earth and the water in it grew ever larger and bigger!

T-Rex: This geyser was only Earth one centimeter tall!

T-Rex: All this land and water was covered in microscopic plants, eating away at our bodies.  Man!  I think it's amazing how little we've lost through each day that we're alive!
T-Rex: I guess we just have to accept that things will always be the same!

Utahraptor: You're saying this on a large-scale?
T-Rex: It's expected!

Utahraptor: Well, it seems like you expect this protection, and we all got by.  All this land and water gives us the opportunity to create something amazing and rare: the ability to breathe in the presence of atmosphere and other cosmic cloud!  Or to eat away at our bodies by either destroying them with pure energy or by dying.

T-Rex: You know what they're say?  They're pretty sure this happened because the "neighbours" didn't let us breathe.  Wow, you live this life in the atmosphere or on the ocean?
Utahraptor: Neither counts, T-Rex!  You're dead now!
T-Rex: Life in the universe is basically the idea that no matter how much we believe in you, the universe can never escape our grasp.  You die, you die, there's nothing left.
