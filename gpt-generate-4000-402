Narrator: ALL OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY SUMMARIZED IN TWO SENTENCES THEATRE

Narrator: A COMIC ABOUT WESTERN PHILOSOPHERS

T-Rex: There's certainly a lot I don't know about science!  For instance, the charge that Newton didn't know anything about science is patently FALSE.
Dromiceiomimus: But what about the famous Conclusive Science?
T-Rex: This is a ridiculous charge!  The Earth is a flat plain, and if we spread it all on top of the ocean, THEN WE CAN ALL SURVIVE THE WEAK.  That's an insanely strong point!

Utahraptor: What about the famous Argument from Exposures?
T-Rex: They're all discredited!

Utahraptor: Sure, but how much energy were needed to produce each emission SEEMS TO BE A MUCH LESSER problem.  What's the point of spending time on a flat plain than sitting around all day?
T-Rex: Uh, I can just find a more convenient solution: we create more of it, and we're like "maybe we should go live in a hollow tube with our eyes closed, and then we'll make more of it in front of your TV screen".

T-Rex: We'd save lives!  Save lives!
