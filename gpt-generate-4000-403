T-Rex: Okay, so, turns out I might be dead someday.

T-Rex: We all might be dead SOMEDAY!

T-Rex: And it would be great for future generations to not have to make the same mistakes I did. Wouldn't this be my chance to become the first man on Earth?
Dromiceiomimus: What if we made the same mistakes two million years ago? I'd be happy with myself, ok?
T-Rex: Then I would be dead and eating chubbs from old hits just afterwards!

Utahraptor: That's not bad, though! I'd be happy eating chubbs from already super successful yet also super thirsty dudes.
T-Rex: True!

Utahraptor: Then I guess I'd be happy drinking water from giant firehose!
T-Rex: Then I guess I'd be happy thirsting to the max!
Utahraptor: Then I guess I'd be happy thirsting to the ultra-rare "super thirsty"
T-Rex: ...And then I guess I'd be medical science, with the only information being how much of my back boils the moment I get out of my bathroom!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear research, I am someone you'd never want to meet but for whatever reason forgot me for!
T-Rex: Sorry if that got boring
