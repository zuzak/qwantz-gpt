T-Rex: What day of the week is it? Friday? Maybe a mix of both?
T-Rex: OKAY FINE

God: T-REX Friday IS where I keep my Probable Evil items!
God: NO I DIDN'T
God: IT'LL BE STILL STOREPLAY TIME

God: ACTUALLY I THINK IT'LL BE STOREPLAY TIME IN PART TWO
T-Rex: Hey guys I just saw a!(s) earthquake! Oh my goodness!
God: HAH HAH
God: NO JUST SOMETHING GOOD

God: ACTUALLY I WAS gonna say SOMETHING HORRIBLE but it was so awesome
T-Rex: Oh! Okay! God: THAT'S 100% OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR ENTIRE LIVES.
Utahraptor: What?

T-Rex: God: I SAID "STOREPLAY TIME" but YOU SAID "MAY THE PAST WITH T-REX".
Utahraptor: What?
God: IT'S JUST THAT 'AHHHHH' SOUNDS EVEN MORE LIKE A TERRIFYING TWO-QUANTY GAME
T-Rex: No way! It sounds a lot more like a skeleton.
Utahraptor: Oh geez, I'm kinda glad we're using the word "skeleton" right now.

Narrator: A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE OF THOSE THINGS
T-Rex: Oh my goodness!
T-Rex: Utahraptor!! You clarified earlier whether or not you believe in a "fifth sense" or not!
