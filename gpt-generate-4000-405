T-Rex: You want to kiss on someone rad? Okay!
T-Rex: That's weird, but whatever!

Narrator: HOW TO KISS ON A PERSON

T-Rex: First off, you should really try to keep your sweetie in place. My advice is simply this:
T-Rex: That's it! You want to kiss on that person at the same time. Then, on the first try, gently lower your voice, making sure you don't over whisper.
T-Rex: You want to sink this ship a new one!

Utahraptor: That's not a advice show!
T-Rex: What?

Utahraptor: It's a "help show" about how to talk to other people about sex.
T-Rex: Yes! And it's great! All you need to do is visit this website and buy a tit-for-tat sex tape!
Utahraptor: But what if I want to show people how to get hot?

T-Rex: Then you need to stalk this woman and make her tell you how much she loves you!
T-Rex: Then you need to tell her how much she loves you and then convince her to get off with you, okay??
