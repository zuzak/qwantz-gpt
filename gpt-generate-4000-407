T-Rex: I have kissed a lady.  I have seen PLENTY of beautiful sunsets.  I even camped out on the edge of the jungle for some of the photos!

T-Rex: But as you can see, the sun was already setting, and the shots were being taken for a later, more expensive sequel!

T-Rex: This was so the PAST, Dromiceiomimus.  I was going to film something after the sun was over, but now the sun is actually just a little girl's laundry, and the sun doesn't really set for awhile.
Dromiceiomimus: The sun does set for a lot of things, T-Rex.
T-Rex: I know!  I SERIOUSLY wanted to film something after the sun was done!

Utahraptor: So what would you make?
T-Rex: I make wacky bikes and make cookie dough and make OTHER foods and things like that.

T-Rex: Then the sun sets and the wacky bikes slowmoats, and the kitchens are full of cake.  I make the food and soon the wacky bikes are creating their OWN version of Christmas outside their doors.  The sequel: A.K.A. "The Next Big Thing".
Utahraptor: It's a good story!
T-Rex: It's a good story!  I tell it to you, Utahraptor.

T-Rex: It is my idea and purpose that I be eaten by a zombie and then later, I wake up to find my actions have been reversed.  I end the book with, "In the new year I will do things differently."
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: ...okay I end the book with, "And then they run things outside their way".
