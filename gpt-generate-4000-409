T-Rex:  Hello, Dromiceiomimus!  Or should I say. . . EMILY??

T-Rex:  Because RIGHT NOW I'M SOLVING THIS PANELS-OUT QUESTION, which is:  what happens if Dromiceiomimus becomes a man?

T-Rex:  I could break UP with her!
Utahraptor:  That's not an answer to your question!  That's madness!

T-Rex:  What if she became a man and ended up as a woman?  That's what I'm suggesting!
Utahraptor:  That's not an answer to your question!  That's insanity!
T-Rex:   - is that you?  What if she became pregnant and ended up as a childless, single mother?

Narrator:  LATER:  RICH PEOPLE IN THE U.S.A.:  THEY DO NOT EXIST:
T-Rex:   - wait, I thought they were going to bomb me!
Narrator:  SOMEONE ELSE ELSE REMARKS ON THIS MATTER
