T-Rex:  Hello!  We are friends on Facebook.  I find this weird.

T-Rex:  I ask what you're doing here, you say wow you could do that to me, and then I loan you a cell phone!

T-Rex:  And then I accelerate the car to match your event, and then give you the money, and then you warm up in my lap in his arms!  INDEED.  I tell you I'm serious, I'm going to pull you up by the hair.  We'll get naked pictures of ourselves and share.
T-Rex:  Maybe it'll make a difference in your life!

Utahraptor:  Maybe it won't.
T-Rex:  I know, right??

Utahraptor:  The point is, people will be more successful if we are more successful at making money from them.  It only works in places I no longer live, where strangers will pay me to make naked selfies bearable.  Utahraptor, remember yesterday?
T-Rex:  Today?

Narrator:  LAST DAY YOU SAW EXPERIMENTAL SEX COMICS
Narrator:  MONDAY NIGHT
Narrator:  SOON:
T-Rex:  That makes you 24B P.O. boxes empty!
