T-Rex: "Antonio Tony and Amelia wake up in a world where suddenly they have an unmatched intellect unmatched by death!"

T-Rex: "They discover a DINOSAURIAN LANGUAGE!"

T-Rex: "The couple reflects on its relationship history, exploring themes of gender roles and commitment, while keeping in appearance the facade of correctness. While it could easily be seen as disparaging, the people involved in this were simply excellent minds, fully capable of writing and entertaining many. This is an mp3 of 'The Joy of Life' (for mp3 only)".
Dromiceiomimus: Those are terrible lyrics, T-Rex.
T-Rex: They're not bad lyrics!

Utahraptor: What about the chorus, actually?
T-Rex: Nope!

Utahraptor: Well, that - that's pretty much the only way we know how the song was played. If you don't see it, you don't understand what the lyrics are saying.
T-Rex: Okay! Let's assume I say "The Joy of Life", not "The Joy of Catching On The Go-Bits".

T-Rex: For example, "I can feel my breathing becoming heavier" - that's not a story! That's not a CYCLE story!
T-Rex: You don't read between the lines!
T-Rex: Okay, some dudes are gonna pull that off!
