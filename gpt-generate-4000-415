T-Rex: It's been what - four thousand years of civilization? That's a little...

T-Rex: ...BOOM!

T-Rex: We're still talking about technology in this very place, in this very great sense. I call it: the future.
Dromiceiomimus: What do you mean by that?
T-Rex: It's a little thing called the "Great Con," Dromiceiomimus. Wait, hold on, I'm gonna go ahead and say what we've been talking about for a long time.

Utahraptor: How do you mean by that?
T-Rex: It's a phrase we use all the time, actually, for reasons that don't really occur to researchers. It's kind of awesome, Utahraptor.

T-Rex: It's - it's one of the reasons we're friends. It's the reason we call our house. It's the reason we buy our groceries. It's the reason we share some of our most memorable photos on Facebook. If we could, we'd say it like "Sorry dude, photos of my friends are ruined!"
Utahraptor: I'm not wasting my time today.
T-Rex: I'm just ruined!

T-Rex: If you ask me, the answer is yes
