T-Rex: What if you wrote a story about modern technology arriving BEFORE it did in our timeline? You'd have computers made out of brass and steam! That sounds like it might be...AWESOME?

T-Rex: You'd also have post-scarcity food and drink cultures!

T-Rex: You'd also have beliefs about technology arriving too quickly and the moral of the story in question! Do you have one Spock, one Saly mix of water and sand, or many decades of conflicting cultural and religious beliefs?
Dromiceiomimus: I think we agree on one thing: technology does not " arrive " quickly.
T-Rex: I wrote about this in my other story, "Religion and the Machine"!

Utahraptor: So you feel like your "story" is more "an argument through the history of time" than a science fiction story?
T-Rex: I do, though!

Utahraptor: Yep! You're reading a story, and then you read a SCIENTIFIC one and you're like, "Eh, science fiction, that's a bit of a long story! I'll remember that as the day when we beat robots on the moon."
T-Rex: I know!! It is an ADRANCE.

Science Fiction Writers Guild (note: "Doctor Who" in science fiction)
T-Rex: Writers Guild, don't tell me you've invented another sentient life form!
T-Rex: I've invented it yourself!
