T-Rex: What did the future have for us with concepts like "TERM RECEIVED!"?  Including free will?

T-Rex: Um, WHO KNOWS?

T-Rex: I think it was horses, I think it was communism, and I think that's what the future is all about.  Well, anyway!  I was just going to say I think the future has all these interesting ideas, and we should all be excited about them.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm sorry we're repeating yourself here.
T-Rex: Angola Maldives, my friend!  She's the spirit that powered the Mongol Empire and the 20th century literature that we know and love!

Utahraptor: Man, we had better not be so negative about communism!  It's a crazy theory!
T-Rex: Correction: the whole theory was that we didn't understand the world, that the only things we could tell us were theories of the spirit world.  Similarly, we didn't have access to true nature knowledge, so we used illusions to check our theories' claims!

Utahraptor: And the British used science to confirm the claims of the British: hey, they just threw in with us ideas that we didn't have!!
Utahraptor: Science being science, and the British science being science, and the Chinese science being science and the Americans being science and the 20th century IT NOW.

Utahraptor: The only way this could be salvaged: all the theories and ideas are revealed to be lies!  Lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie.  Only LIES ABOUT HOW SOME PEOPLE WISH TO REMEMBER THE HOLY DAY MIGHT NOW.
T-Rex: Man, China's ailing!  Lie after lie after lie after lie after lie.  They bury their heads in the ground and call it "the afterlife".  "Happy" is HILARIOUS.
