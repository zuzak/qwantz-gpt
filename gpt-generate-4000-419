T-Rex: A prison organizes a wilderness trip for its inmates, and when the inmates get to the trip's end, the cell is no longer wilderness, but instead, a small, well-lit room. Some take their time to warm up, while others are too late: the inmates turn to the sun and become its victims!

T-Rex: Everyone curses out this horoscope, and then the sun sets on a different, more sinister day.

T-Rex: The sun rises some stars, and those that pass pass pass as well. The stars that pass as fall, fall, and become the doomed ground of my dystopian future.
Dromiceiomimus: And then?
T-Rex: And then the sun does too, and the inmates crowd it and the sun itself collapses!

Utahraptor: It's a perfect dystopia!
T-Rex: It's perfect!!

Utahraptor: Well, except for the deaths of babies, but there's no more nightmares for the rest of time.
T-Rex: Men do sleep with babies!
Utahraptor: Exactly!
Utahraptor: And there's nothing bad happened except maybe they cry a lot.

T-Rex: Y'all be the judge of that!
T-Rex: Also: women cry a lot.
