T-Rex: Man, who is the dude who dropped the ball on that conversation?  I was thinking different!  There was some OTHER dude who I guess had similar issues, and I decided to do something about it!

Narrator: I WAS THINKING Different Things, Not Just Because I Had A Messy Relationship Ha ha!
Narrator: a web card

T-Rex: And I was like "coincidence"?  Or DID I?  Either way, I realized that the whole point was to experiment with being more awesome than everyone else was already being, and so nobody would care if you were still around.  I just wanted the knowledge that you didn't always screw up what you wanted to do.  Maybe someone just met you and said "This is a bad day to throw a party; pull yourself together", and that was it!  WELL, we're just getting that from our shared history now.

Utahraptor: You sure picked a totally original song!
T-Rex: Sure did!

Utahraptor: Great, now you're using it in a political sense.  Why not use it hilariously?  It's not terrible, but you're using it in an economic one!  Hire more ATE.
T-Rex: Tee hee!

Narrator: MANY LICKS:
T-Rex: Maybe it's a good joke without being totally sucky!
Utahraptor: I... guess so?
T-Rex: SERIOUSLY?
