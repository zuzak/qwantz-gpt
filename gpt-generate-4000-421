T-Rex: I have finally come up with a way to become a regular dude!

T-Rex: It's called "rehoming" and it's pretty easy. Just go to a club and meet someone you haven't been around for like two years. They'll say "Oh, I'm happy for you" and you'll say, "Oh, I'm happy for me" and they'll touch you up.

T-Rex: It sounds awful.
Utahraptor: What?

Utahraptor: If you're not going to be rehoming, then you're not going to be able to stay at a club indefinitely.
T-Rex: Oh, I see.
Utahraptor: I'd prefer if the club is a hang out with friends, as it's more convenient.

T-Rex: Yes! I will be a regular guy at parties!
T-Rex: If you want to be rehoming, you will have to find a new club!
Utahraptor: Not necessarily!
T-Rex: YES. I could find a sexy club, AND I would be like "Oh, no, you want to be me? Check out these hot lesbians. They are real hot."

T-Rex: "They are real hot."
