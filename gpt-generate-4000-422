T-Rex: Being tall in a world designed for average people can be dangerous and bad news for your health!

T-Rex: According to a new report!

T-Rex: Dear BodyPartz, "Death Will Not Stop You From Being So Darned!". The reason we know more about height than most people is that when they get older, their bodies SMASH. If they get killed by a falling building they'll make it burst, and if they don't, they die.
Dromiceiomimus: That's pretty terrible!
T-Rex: I know! But I refuse to be taken advantage of either.

Utahraptor: Or to compare, another trendy sport like ice cream with swimming.
T-Rex: Utahraptor!

Utahraptor: You're taking something that's BASICALLY LEGALLY Goodness! You just... you don't know.
T-Rex: Oh, I must have taken a wrong sweetie!
Utahraptor: I'm not sure I swam in water five minutes ago!

T-Rex: My friend: why can't i just make it so the ice cream is smelly and I'm like "screw you" to the punchline?
My friend: by disproving the "screw you" premise I have shown that EVERY RELIGIOUS CONSTANT is totally smelly!
T-Rex: Greek manors are full of man ropes, and you can't have an existing RELIGION more evident than this!
