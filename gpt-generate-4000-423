Narrator: COMICS WITH SUDDEN CHANGES IN GENDER
T-Rex: What a nice day to go out and do manly things.

T-Rex: Maybe I'll flip some cars with my male genitals!

Narrator: SUDDENLY!
T-Rex: I'm a chick! Hah hah hah!
T-Rex: Luckily, I can still do the the things I want, because gender can inform, but does not dictate, personality and self.
Dromeciomimus: That is true!

Utahraptor: So now you're a woman?
T-Rex: Womanly"t"!

Utahraptor: You're a flapper, hap, and you want to flapper. How can you be a flapper? There's women who don't flapper.
T-Rex: Man, I don't see why we have to work so hard to not be a women.
Utahraptor: If you turned down a woman's flapper request, you'd be a sexist monster.

T-Rex: Yep! But look: if you turned down a flapper request of mine, you'd be a flapper!
Utahraptor: I see.
T-Rex: I see.
