Narrator: HOW TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS WITH FRIENDS

T-Rex: Today I will be a video game authority, authority, for real!  With that in mind, I have come up with the following rules!

T-Rex: 1) make new friends by shooting video games! 2) make new friends by having sex!
T-Rex: 3) make new friends by eating different foods equally!
T-Rex: 4) make new friends by licking your lips.
Utahraptor: T-Rex! I think it's super obvious!

Utahraptor: Yes?
Utahraptor: ... It is the most important rule?
Utahraptor: Yep!

T-Rex: Then we're off to explore this new friend!
T-Rex: Enjoy the novelty of our new friend, or find a hobby that is, ASPICIALLY, easier than making old friends again!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, you know those friends?
Utahraptor: Yes I do.

T-Rex: Oh my God, I totally do it all the time!
Utahraptor: You're looking forward to it?
