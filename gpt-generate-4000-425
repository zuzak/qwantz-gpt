T-Rex: Britannic was Titanic's sister ship!  After Titanic sank, they upgraded her to make her MORE SINKPROOF.  But before she could begin transatlantic service, the Great War broke out and she was converted into a GIANT FLOATING HOSPITAL.

T-Rex: And it was as a hospital ship that she struck a mine and sank!

Dromiceiomimus:  That's true, T-Rex, but she sank for very different reasons than the Titanic.  Despite the huge hole in her side, she could've remained afloat and motionless, if it weren't for the fact that nurses had opened portholes on the lower decks to get a breeze!  Water flooded in as soon as the ship listed.  As much as the Titanic is a symbol for hubris, the Britannic is a symbol of how SHIT GOES FOUL sometimes no matter how well you plan.

T-Rex: INTERESTING.
Utahraptor: The ship sank only a few miles from shore, didn't she?
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: The captain actually gave the order to gun the engines and beach the ship on the shore, but some lifeboats were launched against orders, two of which ended up DRIFTING INTO THE PROPELLERS, with pretty much the results you'd expect.
Utahraptor: Holy smokes.
T-Rex: Yeah.

Narrator: THE MORAL: A CAKED MARROW LATER:
T-Rex: Shit certainly DOES go foul sometimes!
