T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! Oh MAN.  I'll never work that out.

T-Rex: I'll make up a THIRD!

T-Rex: Books I'm not going to read anymore!
Dromiceiomimus: But you've written a lot of books, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Really?  More than enough?
Dromiceiomimus: More than enough with such titles as "The Woman Who Pressured Herself to Be More Compulsive"?
T-Rex: That sounds plausible enough!

Utahraptor: You want to read about a woman who has been chemically induced to repress certain cell-syndromal and genetic information?
T-Rex: That's what I've been told?

Utahraptor: Yeah, the idea is that she did this to gain superpowers.  But the moral of the story is, she didn't do it, and she's out of the picture!
T-Rex: I'm not!
Utahraptor: No you have not! You have secrets, remember?

T-Rex: Every one!
T-Rex: Every one.
