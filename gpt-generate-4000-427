T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!

T-Rex: I will consider it as a Critique!

T-Rex: In doing so, I will become truly "ay"!

T-Rex: When I speak, things will be "ayier"!

T-Rex: I will also become "erotic"!
Utahraptor: Are you talking to yourself?

T-Rex: I did not!
Utahraptor: Well, that's something!

T-Rex: I think I get the "yay are" feeling, you know?
Utahraptor: Not really!
Utahraptor: I am "yay are" and therefore "erotic".

T-Rex: No! You're "yay are not" and "erotic".
