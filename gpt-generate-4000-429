Narrator: Compressed Film Comics: Secrets to Perfection

T-Rex:  "Boogie" Drum " By The Sea "

T-Rex:  The comic was about a "kwach"!
Dromiceiomimus:  I didn't know "kwach" was called that.  It seems to be a derivative work of the same name.
T-Rex:  I think the French thought it was old slang that was being used in reference to a horse.  The Romans thought it meant "a trot", which must have been a horse owner!

Utahraptor:  You know, you don't know much about compressed natural gas?
T-Rex:  We do!

Utahraptor:  It's a small gas produced by greedy multinationals.
T-Rex:  It's a small gas that the public saves and holds for their security!
Utahraptor:  Yeah, it's cute that the characters live in a world where the public can be big into their profits so that they can have hidden lives and be invisible to the public.

T-Rex:  Holy crap, Utahraptor, that is an interesting premise that needs more citation!
