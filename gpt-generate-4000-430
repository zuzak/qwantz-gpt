T-Rex: My new literary epic is about a man who puts everything in quotation marks!
T-Rex: Whoops, pardon me.

T-Rex: It's about a "man" who puts "everything" in "quotation marks"!

Dromiceiomimus: So he's not really a man? Is that what the quotation marks mean?
T-Rex: Can one truly be a man Dromiceiomimus, when one puts "everything" in quotation marks?
Dromiceiomimus: Well surely there's exceptions if it is not just everything, but "everything".
T-Rex: Well surely there is some places where it is not just everything, but "everything".

Utahraptor: It's tricky to nail down a parable!
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yeah! You have to consider "What is the point?" and "What is the one thing that can't be reduced to 'I'm sick'??"
T-Rex: "No, that would be better; I'm stuck in the past."
Utahraptor: Oh, that is a tricky one to write!

T-Rex: "The man who makes the distinction between good and bad is the man who is morally compromised by failing to consider any real downsides."
Utahraptor: I get your point.
T-Rex: "The moral is 'I'm sick'"?
Utahraptor: Alright, fine, one way or the other. We're friends. We only make jokes about him or her like we're slutty.
T-Rex: Ha ha, no, man. I'M insulting you.

Narrator: LATER: T-REX ASICS
T-Rex: You know what? I think it's pretty rad that you want to make a career out of it, like so?
Utahraptor: Emails?
T-Rex: Son, do you ever get emails from people who are A) INSULTS TO CREATING SITE OR B) KICKING OFF THE TELEPHONE??
T-Rex: T-REX
T-Rex: Son, do you ever get emails from people who are A) INSULTS TO CREATE SITE OR B) KICKING OFF THE TELEPHONE??
