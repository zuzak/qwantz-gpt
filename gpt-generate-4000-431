T-Rex: "Antonio Tony and Amelia wake up in a world where suddenly they're not related!"

T-Rex: "Oh crap!!"

T-Rex: "It's okay, I kinda understand. She's the nurse and Antonio was the pickpocket. All of those things happened. But this is PRECISELY how it turned out."
Dromiceiomimus: The world we leave behind is vanishing point, T-Rex! We line up all over again: cavemen, pickpockets, and then pickpockets again.
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, this is PRECISELY how it turned out!!

Utahraptor: All these world events have left you baffled, Antonio!
T-Rex: Utahraptor, this is PRECISELY how it turned out!!

Utahraptor: The world we leave behind can be incredible: shifting, planet-wide, recurring.
T-Rex: You're telling me! I'M ALREADY READING THE BOOK!!
Utahraptor: And you're not even writing it down, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Utahraptor,this is a -a a terrible idea! You just mess with the main characters, and the book turns out hilariously different things happened to them differently!

T-Rex: If only we could stop looking at it from now on, Dromiceiomimus!
Utahraptor: That's funny you're so quick to laugh, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Awww! How's that?
