T-Rex: I have started a radio show! It is an advice show! Everybody, do you want to buy a used boat?

T-Rex: I do!

T-Rex: The only problem is that the Titanic had three problems: one, it was way too old and two, it was on fire were all people in the water and it had to go on without a power for a long while.
T-Rex: Three is a lot of water. So, um, let's find out how old you think the water is.
Dromiceiomimus: Ah, the - excuse me?
T-Rex: It's an old woman. She passed away last night.

Utahraptor: I'm coming to your show, T-Rex!
T-Rex: No!

Utahraptor: I'm just a guy who's been thinking about buying a boat. No dice, guys.
T-Rex: Ache!
Utahraptor: No, don't play dice with me. You want certainty, T-Rex.

T-Rex: I WANT YOU TO TRY, T-REX.
T-Rex: I want you to say "ha ha, that boat was actually so much more than just a boat!".
T-Rex: Guys!!
T-Rex: GUESS WHAT, I'M SORRY I REALLY JUST HAD SO MUCH REGRET FOR A VERY EXTREMELY POWERFUL TEN YEAR OLD
