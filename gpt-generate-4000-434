T-Rex: I've entered a poetry contest!

T-Rex: I enter because I'm really excited about poetry!

T-Rex: I can't get excited about any subject, so I enter: poetry! And the prizes are all: VANILLA emoji!
Dromiceiomimus: emoji!
T-Rex: OMG

Utahraptor: Let's hear your poetry!
T-Rex: Okay!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, how did you know about my love of poetry? Were you excited to write a poem for me?
Utahraptor: Nope! Sorry! That was a stupid guess.
T-Rex: OKAY! I just realized I couldn't use my Grandmother's emoji!

God: I'M NOT INSOLVED
T-Rex: I had to guess! T-Rex: I had an EVEN LAVENT FEAR OF PUNCTUATION.
T-Rex: OH WELL OH I'M SORRY BUT IT'S JUST LIKE I WAS INSOLVED
