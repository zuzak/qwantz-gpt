T-Rex:  Alright, so I'd like to build a time machine here, and then return to my own planet and live my own life again.  But then I'd have to build my time machine AFTER I return to my own planet.

T-Rex:  And THEN, after I'm gone, I can't do that either!

T-Rex:  And if I'm gone, the only way I know is to make my own super-heated super-heated super-heated super-heated super-heated super-heated super-heated super-heated super-heated super-heated planet...
Dromiceiomimus: ...start a corporation?
T-Rex:  Two words:  SUPER-HEATED SUPER-HEATED SUPER-HEATED SUPER-HEATED SUPER-HEATED

T-Rex:  OBVIOUSLY THAT.
Utahraptor:  But suppose there's a war to prevent it from burning itself out, huh?

Utahraptor:  Yeah, and you've got the means to stop it.  The corporation will collapse, and you've got to be the one to donate Nobel Prizes to it: I want that.
T-Rex:  I want THAT.
Utahraptor:  Man, I don't even know what the planet is!
