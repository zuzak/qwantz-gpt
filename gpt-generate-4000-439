T-Rex: Okay, so APPARENTLY a singular, gender-neutral "they" has a long and proud history as a generic, commercial euphemism!

T-Rex: It was also an essential part of the "I" word in the "E" word, as gendered nouns: this tension!

T-Rex: As you know, the word "they" comes from Latin, which means "female" and is used by poets to represent backwards-universal attributions of beauty and truth. In Middle English, "they" meant "queen".
Dromiceiomimus: Are you sure?
T-Rex: Sometimes some words are taken literally, but they're still there!

T-Rex: For example, I'd say "It is they who wear the most clothing" and I'd go on to say "If it be true that they are clothed, then I am clothed".
Dromiceiomimus: Perfect!
T-Rex: Well - sometimes it works if it be true that I am a pretty pretty girl.

T-Rex: The word is now used by psychologists to refer to either a feeling of aroused excitement or of someone having a really arousing erection, as well as by people who are familiar with people with stronger sexual and/or reproductive characteristics.

Utahraptor: I think you're putting too much symbolism into the symbolism of "they".
T-Rex: The "they" there is MANY.

Utahraptor: Not to mention the many slang words that are only meant to mean "similarity" or "similarity of yourself to" and NOTHING GENERAL.
T-Rex: I actually don't think that's a bad thing! I even thought it was a bad thing. Do you take a moment to register that I'm here?
Utahraptor: Yep! Perhaps you need to take a deep, sustained interest in what I'm doing right now, and alter your entire life as a whole.

T-Rex: Hah! I forgot to register!!
T-Rex: HAH
