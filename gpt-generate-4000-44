T-Rex: I have a friend...

T-Rex: A friend who I'll never be able to visit again, and who I'll never get to know because I'll always wonder if I even remember to feed him!

T-Rex: I'll never get to know him, Dromiceiomimus.  Because I'll never be able to find even a smidgen of information about a guy who I've already seen for the first time!
Dromiceiomimus: Well, if you were hungry, would you do much more than shuffle around in my face?
T-Rex: I could do a lot more, Dromiceiomimus! I could join the legion of immortal men and serve as your mouth for delivery!

Utahraptor: What are you talking about?  I could eat my words?
T-Rex: Eating my words!

Utahraptor: No, I'm just saying - what would I say?
T-Rex: Served with my own ambitions!
Utahraptor: Well...
Utahraptor: Did you even eat your words?

T-Rex: Not when I went back and told you, and you've got to be SITTING THEM IN MY MOUTH now!
