Narrator: COMICS THAT END IN "OH SHIIII-"
T-Rex: Wow! The plants are nice and the birds are singing and the sun is almost down from the top of the sky.

T-Rex: What a beautiful day!

Narrator: ENDING ONE:
T-Rex: Well, I guess we'll see about that!
Utahraptor: The sun's down, T-Rex!

Utahraptor: The birds are singing and the sun is almost exactly at the bottom of the sky.
T-Rex: We might be able to see it though!
Utahraptor: The birds are still singing!

Narrator: ENDING TWO:
T-Rex: Well, that was pretty much the best sun you've ever seen!
