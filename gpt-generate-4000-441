T-Rex: Let's say all vegetables are suddenly super nutritious, thanks to a process of weight loss!

T-Rex: What will they be called CLASSIC vegetables?

T-Rex:GREATEST vegetables. THE MEATIN' vegetables. I don't know, but I imagine they'd be salad, with vegetables. And baby, I imagine a big bodied bod being used as a bod!
Dromiceiomimus: You could probably make your own with less or less all the vegetables.
T-Rex: NO. I did, however, experiment with "bodacious" and it turns out a bods can be either mass or soft.

Utahraptor: So lay this theory across the vegetarian kitchen and it'll be like, "Oh, y'all are great, now just cook a meal!"

Utahraptor: You already have a shared kitchen with a full plate, no need to explain why.
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: And you teach it to the hungry bod?
Utahraptor: Yep! And you share it with the hungry bod too!

T-Rex: Man, who cooks a meal for all the people in the world for one simple reason: food? Are the bodgies going to gobble my food if I don't?
Utahraptor: I won't!
Utahraptor: I will, and I WILL, and only YOU make shared food for the hungry bod.

T-Rex: You win, everyone!
T-Rex: And when you're hungry you don't even have to give up delicious memories!
