T-Rex: I have the greatest idea for a movie!  Oh snap!
T-Rex: It's time!!

T-Rex: Okay, so what happens next is you're a good guy, Utahraptor.  But he can betray his friend and get caught!  It's not that great.
Utahraptor: Hah hah!  It is great, though.  I'm going to have a feature film.
T-Rex: What?  It's terrible!  There's a scene in there in which a really good guy gets mugged and is later found guilty.  We only get to see one scene, and that's the scene with the slow, slow death of the mugger!

Narrator: IF THE MUGGLE GETS CALLED AGAIN:
T-Rex: What?  It's terrible!!
T-Rex: Get off my back, Utahraptor!!

T-Rex: That is a very real and painful scene in there.  And I would like it to be shown as a scene in which the audience gets to see the end of the mugger mugger thing.
Utahraptor: T-Rex!  I'm not mugging!  I'm just off the beaten path of taxidermy.
T-Rex: There's a reason we call this a scene!  I thought it would be a bit better than regular people thought it was!!

T-Rex: The fact that you're not a mugger is still there.  Why not call it as such, right?  It's a great ending!
Utahraptor: What else could there be?
T-Rex: Lots of things??
