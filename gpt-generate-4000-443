T-Rex: Two people, Utahraptor and myself, go undercover as a team and take on the biggest bullies in the world!

T-Rex: We fight them tooth and nail... by dentists!

T-Rex: And we're not even done yet! We need your help getting... T-Rex... the DANGERS.
Dromiceiomimus: Usual Suspects, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I'm sure we'll pull through!

T-Rex: But please, you don't hollered to me. We're not muscle people. We're not cartographers. We don't invent cars.
Utahraptor: Not actually, dude!

T-Rex: You know what we do on film? We go around beating up guys on the street. I bet we're good at it.
Utahraptor: I know, I know! I bet it's innate.
T-Rex: Just let me go through this business end with one person, and I'll give you an analogy.

Utahraptor: You know what we do in movies? We go around setting up and shooting and all the big laughs that surround us!
T-Rex: Hey, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: This is my take: good, but empty calories for dessert!
