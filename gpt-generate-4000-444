Narrator: MODERN EMERGENCY
T-Rex: That's what's awesome about it, actually!

T-Rex: WELL, actually, no-one has ever thought to me to suggest that entropy could be reduced by nuclear fusion to be in a state of zero.  Is there any reason why zero entropy could be maintained in a nuclear environment?
T-Rex: I believe there is, because without an "elements" view, "quantum physics" could not be applied.

Utahraptor: But folks on the quantum/entropy side of things, like photons and holes, you'd never get into a nuclear environment!
T-Rex: I don't see how!

T-Rex: If you look at it in the quantum/entropy sense, then maybe we'd all get used to it, right? At the quantum/entropy level, I guesscha thing is way better than it could be, because it's just a different, but still awesome, way of representing quantity and space.
Utahraptor: I guess you could call it... Pure Quantity!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE NOBODY DIES:
T-Rex: So the bullet didn't kill him, but the brain got pregnant?
T-Rex: That's a fractional approximation of quantum physics!
T-Rex: I'm just not convinced that's what you're looking for in a universe?
