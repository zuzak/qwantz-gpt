T-Rex: What do you get when you throw a few pounds of Breadcrumbs around and see how good they are? I'll tell you what I think I'll do best:

T-Rex: LOSE THEM!

Dromiceiomimus: But they taste like...stick-on bread?
T-Rex: Yeah, just a little stick-on bread.
Dromiceiomimus: awww dromiceiomimus

Utahraptor: Bread's a tasty thing to have in a cake, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's true!

Utahraptor: Yeah, but they kinda taste like...whatever, stick-on bread.
T-Rex: Yeah, stick-on bread. Dude, it's not like I can't make it up!
Utahraptor: "It's Just": you can't really describe something taste-good, even if it's a cake.

T-Rex: Man! I tried "lactose intolerant" but it just sort of tasted like...whatever, stick-on bread.
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I'm on hold!
