T-Rex: I have a great idea for a comic that'll please everyone! Okay! How about a story where a building is surrounded on all sides by a glow-filled zone of LED lights and crunching metal. Everyone gets to read what's going on, and then they're taken out of their houses and put in a study where they all live.

T-Rex: They all go home to their rad, pre-pubescent children.

T-Rex: The comic doesn't get old any more, you guys! Comics is old, Dromiceiomimus! We'll be making movies about it.
Dromiceiomimus: I imagine!
T-Rex: I'm pretty sure we'll be making comics than go on to bigger things. Like big-city TV!

Utahraptor: I like that story better.
T-Rex: It's no longer scary! It's DEFINITELY good.

Utahraptor: I too like the "flashmojo" one, but I'm giving it away at my next comic!
T-Rex: Go have your comic now, because who cares? You've got a comic for everyone else! Hahahah, everyone gets to read the same thing!!

Narrator: MUCH LATER:
T-Rex: Oh damn, is anyone out there thirsty?
