T-Rex: I am a guy who said "five dollars an hour" in conversation.  Now I am saying "thanks for dollars, dude!"

T-Rex: It is the first thing I am going to say to someone, hopefully, and I can say it without blabbing: "Five dollars an hour, please!"

T-Rex: It is a line from the song "30 Rock" by the same name, but with a slightly different take on the words.
Dromiceiomimus: "HEY GUYS WHAT'S UP GUYS ACTUALLY"
T-Rex: A line from the movie "Goodfellas"??

Utahraptor: So your line sounds like a movie!
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: And ANYONE who follows me on Twitter will be able to figure it out soon.  It's like watching a movie trivia show, only the first few episodes have clues that the movie is about to come out!
Utahraptor: You're late for the trivia, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Nope!  It's always Wednesday.

God: SO UM I WAS PLANNING ON SPEAKING SOMETHING NEW BUT HAVING THAT WAY OF doing STUFF TIED TO MY WISHES
T-Rex: A tv show?  What's it called?
God: LISTEN
God: THIS IS A REVIEW OF MY WORK AND YOUR PROBLEMS ARE STILL SO MUCH FANFIC THAT I THINK it's fine
