T-Rex: You guys! I just wrote the best will. It's the best will!

God: DOES IT HAVE NIGHTS IN A HAUNTED HOUSE
T-Rex: It DOES!

T-Rex: And that's just where it starts. After my would-be heirs spend the night in the haunted house, which is clearly specified in my will to be ACTUALLY HAVING LARGE DEATH IN JUST A FEW MINUTES, THEN THE LONG AND STUNGERS END.
Dromiceiomimus: It doesn't specify anything, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Um, exactly! What does it say?

Utahraptor: It's implied!
T-Rex: It's MY will!

Utahraptor: Well, that's good, because then I can act on it and make the will ACTUALLY HAVING LARGE DEATH IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.
T-Rex: I'll act on it, Utahraptor! The damage is done!
Utahraptor: Things can't be better, T-Rex!

Narrator: SHORTLY:
T-Rex: THESE DEATH STRIKES ARE NOT TO BE WISHED
