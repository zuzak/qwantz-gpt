T-Rex: I like your jokes, but I can't hear them. They're on your damn CD players!

T-Rex: I have something that I want to tell!

T-Rex: Okay, so here's the thing. Most songs start their songs in a similar order, but they end up kinda crazy variations on basic "here's how to die" lads. It's no biggie! I just like the "and" or the "you're going to" or the "it's all or nothing" lads.
T-Rex: Man.

Utahraptor: I bet there's a song here that might make your family lukewarm, but that's a song!
T-Rex: That's a GREAT song!

Utahraptor: Why would you want to marry a song that sounds like it might make you sick? It's not like there's a whole lot of room for joy in songs.
T-Rex: Well, I guess I guess I could ponder that question more fully afterwards, huh?

T-Rex: I wouldn't be able to lie: I'm busy!
