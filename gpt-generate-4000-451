T-Rex: Everyone!
T-Rex: You're probably thinking "eh, looks like we only get one vote!!", but the VOTE NOW: algorithm! WISHES. So, um, the result remains the same, but we're now weighted in to the proportional generation equation!

T-Rex: AND IT'S FINE. The winner gets a say in whether or not they get to be the president!
Utahraptor: Sounds great!

T-Rex: Well, I mean, I'll ask them if they want to be the president, and they'll say "No" without hesitation! And UNSOLICITED, I canrite that it's better than trying to stone-cold start a conversation with my friend Willard Hamlet!
Utahraptor: That's not a very "cooperative" relationship!
T-Rex: I know, right? I don't see a problem w/ it.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE HEIST:
Mr. Tusks: Will you help me tie the two of us to a pole and place my ideas on the table?
T-Rex: I will!
Mr. Tusks: Hah! Mr T-Rex, your ideas just can't get any more cooooooonastic!
