T-Rex: If someone says something is "a whale of a good time", I'm expecting to see some marine life.  Why aren't these marine life?

T-Rex: Ouch for marine life!

T-Rex: The good news is that there's NO consensus on what constitutes a "whale of a good time"!  All you can use it for is hubris, my friend!  Observe:
Dromiceiomimus: A whale of a good time is one of those "cannibalistic whale-related activities" that -
T-Rex: - CAN be legally defined as anything from eating to owning.  But there's one issue you can't legally legally eat: YOUR BODIES.

Utahraptor: I can't believe you're trying to make me look bad, but your raw fat will keep getting worse.
T-Rex: I know, right?  It's not like we're being told to buy up ANY animal life that's around now.

Utahraptor: Yeah, but your raw liver will keep getting burned away at some of this future marine life you eat.
T-Rex: ...
Utahraptor: As well!  Come on.  I think we've made a pretty terrible first impression on someone reading this.

Narrator: EPILOGUE: T-REX FINDS OUT THAT "A MEANWHILE WORTH IT" ACTUALLY TAKES PLENTY OF CAPITALISM ADVENTURES, CORRECT.
T-Rex: Looks like profits go to the CIA!
Narrator: WOW, WOW.
Narrator: Don't worry dude: your travels will be rated as good enough to make me rich, and my cup of tea is the only thing that'll keep on going.
