T-Rex: I had the strangest dream last night! There was this disease going around that made people really - violent, I guess?

T-Rex: Anyway, it affected these two women who I guess lived at my house!

T-Rex: It was really creepy, because these women would SEEM fine, but then they'd just keep trying to get close to me, no matter what I did. They wanted to kill me!
Dromiceiomimus: Whoah! Sounds like somebody is afraid of women!
T-Rex: No I'm not! It's just that dreams always sound really symbolic when they're described, that's all!

Utahraptor: I don't know, sounds like you think women are a threat!
T-Rex: I don't!

Utahraptor: Well, it affected one of the women, and she said it kept happening.
T-Rex: That's - that's a new thing I'm thinking about a lot right now!
Utahraptor: No it's not! It's not!
Utahraptor: WHAT?

T-Rex: Two nights ago I dreamt I was about to be gang raped, and then I remembered that I had sexual relations with a woman.
T-Rex: The events of that night were entirely different!
T-Rex: I believe that if I'd known at the time?
