T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! Oh MAN.  I'll have everyone's SECRETS.

T-Rex: I'll be famous!

T-Rex: I want to be famous because without him, we wouldn't be able to make ANYONE's lives better.  And I want to be famous because without me, we'd be laughed at and laughed at something...less interesting?
T-Rex: That's the worst kind of joke! It's so BORING and we should all just get used to it, Utahraptor.

Utahraptor: I think it's pretty clear that without your brilliant ideas and track records, you'd still be in a pretty good place.
T-Rex: Totally!! I know you're in the know-who!

T-Rex: I mean, come on, this is a great idea. I don't know why you're making all these jokes, but I thought maybe you should get on board!
Utahraptor: I think you should set "best picture camera ever" aside for a little while, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Aw man!  I thought maybe I should be doing that instead?

T-Rex: My friend Utahraptor thinks I should be doing that instead!
T-Rex: Why?
