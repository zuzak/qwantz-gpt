T-Rex: I am not a guy who will sit down and rewrite The Lord of the Rings history so everyone knows who he was! I WILL ONLY WRITE MY NEW BOOKS.

T-Rex: That is until there's this guy who wants to profit from my non-hilarious escapades!

T-Rex: And he wants to profit from all the people he wrongfully calls "his friends". And he wants to profit from everyone he wrongfully calls "his enemies", because if he didn't, he wouldn't have such an enemy, and he already has such an enemy, yet he's still a dickish person.
And then he wants to profit from people who let him get away with doing anything he wants, even if it's just writing a story where Gandhian superintelligent women help him get out of bed and go into the sunset!

Utahraptor: No, this isn't writing "a.k.a."!
T-Rex: WRONG NO. THIS IS WRONG WHILE TALKING ABOUT MY NEW BOOKS!

T-Rex: So! My new books are stories about being wrong, and maybe that makes you look a little more like a jerk?
Utahraptor: Or maybe they're memoirs... about the changes, the ways?
T-Rex: Oh my gosh! I can see that!

Narrator: A FEW DAYS LATER, T-REX DISCOVERS WITH HIS HISTORY EXPOSURE:
T-Rex: Aw crap! That sucks!
T-Rex: History is sucky and I lose!
