T-Rex: "Antonio Tony and Amelia wake up in a world where suddenly everyone has gone blind - EXCEPT FOR THEM. Antonio and Amelia turn to each other and whisper 'Oh sheesh, everyone has gone blind except for us!' so now we know what's going on."

T-Rex: "They go outside and see a lot of folks bumping into things!"

T-Rex: "They're not sure what they can do. They've heard that in the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king, but neither really wants to be a king, and that's mainly because neither is a guy with a brain that's way smaller than his body. Antonio whispers, 'What is happening to me??' and she smiles and adds, 'probably - I don't know.' Antonio whispers, 'What?' and she smiles and adds, "I whispered those words to Antonio. Maybe you should have a king to listen to.' Antonio nodded, and they shared the words, and then they were happy."

Utahraptor: I really don't see how it goes any better.
T-Rex: It does though!

T-Rex: It's not like he's wasting a moment just talking about it, and they have a lot of conversation going on. But it's getting pretty cold out, and they're like "oh, it's going to be fascinating, I have to go get ice cream."
Utahraptor: ...I think that's never actually happened.
T-Rex: Huh! I guess SOMETIMES they were supposed to talk about it, and then "got" and "got away" and then "I got away" and then "I now have to now take on the responsibilities of a king."

T-Rex: ...Huh.
