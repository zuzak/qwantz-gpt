T-Rex: I know a lot about Super Mario, and I know a lot about the Life of a Super Mario.  I know a lot about nutrition.  I even know a lot about nutrition and how nutrition works!

T-Rex: Then, who is going to be my friend?

Dromiceiomimus: Probably you, T-Rex!
T-Rex: DEFINITELY, I'm going to be the guy who gets WAY DERRICKENED when something bad happens.  Hey, here's a super! - SUPER!  SUPER!
Dromiceiomimus: "Here's a wiry, cuter Mario that'll make any ol' guy jealous."
T-Rex: FINE.  Here's a Mario that is really only a little cuter than Jane Doe on a pretty okay day.

Utahraptor: That's not a real pun, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Utahraptor, that's just a stupid line in a comic.

Utahraptor: It's real easy to make puns when you're talking about Mario.  It's easy to make a pun that is both a foregone conclusion and a hilarious joke that also makes you sound like an adult here.
T-Rex: Well, I guess we'll see about that?

Narrator: LATER:
Mr. Pita-Kitty: What's this...
T-Rex: I'm sorry but a fossilized hand raised over a snow-covered field.  I wasn't thinking about how nutrition is KICKIN' ALL THE TIME!!
