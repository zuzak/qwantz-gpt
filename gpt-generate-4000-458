T-Rex: Normally people have trouble with sequels after their first idea is so, and I'll say it, so transcendentally brilliant. But not me! I have ideas for basically infinite sequels.

T-Rex: Basically infinite out-of-genre cover sequels, that is!

T-Rex: When my explosion-centric disaster movie comes out and people want more, I will say to them, "No, ACTUALLY, you want the same thing, but this time, as a gross-out comedy!"
Dromiceiomimus: So the story starts out the same, but the guy slips on some lube and then lands in an old jock strap!
T-Rex: Hah! PRECISELY. And it keeps happening throughout the film. The power goes out, and nationwide, folks slip on the lube.

Utahraptor: The next sequel could be a road trip movie!
T-Rex: EVEN BETTER.

T-Rex: Some TEENS go out on a road trip and unwittingly stay just ahead of all the destruction! You can watch it on the regular to remember when you left your room, or go home if you want to look out the window and smell the roses.
Utahraptor: That's a terrible idea.
T-Rex: And it doesn't even get you out of bed! YOU ARE REMINDED OF YOUR BODY DURING THE NIGHT.

T-Rex: Every movie is different, but worse when they all go wrong: every idea is replaced with a different one!
T-Rex: The power goes out, and DESIRE replaces us with nothing, and the world is consumed by starvation.
