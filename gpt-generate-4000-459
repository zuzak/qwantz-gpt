T-Rex: You know what's awesome? When there's a story on the news, and then they go to people "on the street" for their reactions to the story!

T-Rex: Wait, did I say "awesome"?! I meant "HOLY COW< SO TERRIBLE!"

T-Rex: They're stopping the flow of information to literally ask RANDOM STRANGERS what they think. The only way it'd be acceptable is if they prefaced these stupid segments with "and now, here's what some strange folks on their way to do something better had to say!" but THEY NEVER DO.

Utahraptor: It's not that bad, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's SO BAD.

Utahraptor: Well, more than likely, this is a stupid conversation, and you're going to have to take the lead.
T-Rex: Well, I'M NOT!
Utahraptor: Man, take the lead.
T-Rex: I've GOT NOTHING TO TELL!!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: What? SOMEONE's stupid!
T-Rex: I'm not!
