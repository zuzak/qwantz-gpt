Narrator: STERN RELIGIOUS COMICS
interview: "Religion shifts in opposite direction:" - no religion ever said that!

T-Rex: That's not what I meant!

T-Rex: Okay, so what if you had a god, and you wanted to see if religion could ever be religion again?
Dromiceiomimus: What if you had a non-god and you wanted to see if religion could ever be religion?
T-Rex: OH MY GOD they would never have said that!  Was it you, Dromiceiomimus?  No god?
Dromiceiomimus: It was them, I guess.
T-Rex: This somehow validates my own feelings, Dromiceiomimus!

Utahraptor: So you want to see if religion can be religion?
T-Rex: No!

Utahraptor: It's not me telling you to get religion, T-Rex.  They're the same religion!  That doesn't mean they can't be religion!
T-Rex: But I feel the old "there's a difference between science and fiction" argument is flawed.
Utahraptor: I know, I know!  I'll let you down on this, but frig!

Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: So let's hear this new argument: "Reality, we are in a state of quandary when it comes to quandary (yet) mean 'no-one should mistake us for them'!"
T-Rex: YES
T-Rex: LET'S DO THIS
