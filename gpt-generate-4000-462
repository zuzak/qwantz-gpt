T-Rex: I know you're getting a kick out of a question, today, CERTAIN ANSWERS TO MY PROBLEM!

T-Rex: You're always all, "hey! I wonder if I'm good enough to answer the question!"

T-Rex: But I'm serious! What's the problem?
Dromiceiomimus: Somewhat Asimovian?
T-Rex: I've never seen the problem with that!  Perhaps a little pornography?

Utahraptor: Don't you worry if you make light of modern technology unexpectedly, like in the movie "Gone Is The Day"!

Utahraptor: No, that might not be the case.  I bet people who tried to invent it have had none luck.  What if they found some REALLY REALLY FRIGGIN' C300 units on the internet that I forgotten about?
T-Rex: I might have to give up some of my sense of humour now!

Utahraptor: I might!  It might be a good idea to bang some CIGARETTEs together while I'm out!
T-Rex: Oh sure! Then we can go visit the holodeck of my life!
Utahraptor: Let's do that eventually!  Soon we'll be CUSTOMIZED AND DELICIOUS EACH AND EVERY DAY!
T-Rex: WE'LL BE GREATER OR LUCKY?
Utahraptor: Let's do it eventually!

OLD PHONE: DO YOU EVER
T-Rex: Hah hah, sorry, I don't hear from him!
