T-Rex: Often we'll set up a ship and see what it can do - sometimes, actually!  Will it sink or rise?  Let's decide YES or NO!

T-Rex: That's the beauty of have a life!

T-Rex: When it goes, you get groceries, rent, and sometimes your entire old life will be behind you.  But if it doesn't, you have no idea how your old life will fare in the future.  And that's terrible.  If you think "no" there's no way!
Dromiceiomimus: You've got a life ahead of you, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I know, right?

Utahraptor: What if I die and LITERALLY share the news of my life ahead?
T-Rex:
Utahraptor: You die and come back as a totally fake person!

T-Rex: Utahraptor, there's nothing worse than failing to live life to its fullest!
Utahraptor: Just like, say, failing to live long enough to save against the rigours of the lactation market!
T-Rex: Just like, say, failing to save against the baby boondocks.

T-Rex: Just like, say, failing to have kids even though I was their age!
