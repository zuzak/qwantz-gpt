T-Rex: Is it that time again? Has the hour finally been struck? Should I send not to know for whom the bell tolls, because it tolls for me? IS IT TRULY TIME ...

T-Rex: ... FOR MORE EUPHEMISMS FOR SEX??

T-Rex: Okay! Let's call sex "wacky times for two or more, but actually usually one", "kinda weird hugs" "kinda weird hugs with benefits", or "annoying the bed".

Dromiceiomimus: And let's call kissing "the check to see if my lips are smushy".

T-Rex: AND let's call the amount of time it's right now "the moment I kiss".

Dromiceiomimus: And let's call your life "a complex mixture of love, alcohol, and erotica".

T-Rex: YES.

Dromiceiomimus: Okay! Let's call your body "a well-lit, well-lit pathway to sex, and a double-entendre that way"

T-Rex: YES.

Dromiceiomimus: Let's call your body "a slick pit of mucus, sexually AND psychocritically conjugated".

T-Rex: Let's call your life "a journey from sex to sex, finally, AND back again, AND with sex still possible, OKAY"?

Dromiceiomimus: Let's call your life "a double-edged sword, involving love AND of course, erotica."

T-Rex: Let's call your body "an alveolarious fortress of mucus, finally"

Dromiceiomimus: Let's call your life "a colossal red-green HUBA LITTLE CLAW"

T-Rex: Let's write a story about a man who left behind a beautiful but uncomplaining portrait of being beautiful, but then came back a horribly deformed corpse!
Dromiceiomimus: Yes!
T-Rex: I forgive the initial shock, and the long and the gay
