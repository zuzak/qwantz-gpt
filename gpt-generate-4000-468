T-Rex: Historically speaking, we are WAY more "mobile" than "mobile-friendly".  If we were to compare apples to grapes, we'd expect a bit more "mobile friendly" from Apple.

T-Rex: This is like apples versus grapes!!

T-Rex: Historically speaking, I think we're WAY more "mobile" than "mobile-friendly" in many ways: fewerer physical barriers to travel; fewer software updates; and so on!  I just thought we'd compare apples to grapes instead.
Dromiceiomimus: GARYs have these little golden apples!
T-Rex: What are they?

Utahraptor: Are these...graphic aliens?
T-Rex: No, those are not "graphic aliens".

Utahraptor: Are they actually...graphic aliens from another universe?
T-Rex: ...Yes.  Their names suggest that they are technologically and culturally, - heck, I don't know much about aliens - and quite frankly, they find fun in warring with one another.  It is a fun story!
Utahraptor: ...Well, I think it would be a pretty good story.

God: T-REX THE GRAVE LASER BELIEVES IN BATMAN AND ROBOT IN FICTION BUT BECOMES A "PLATONIC" GUY WHO CAN FIRE A MISSILE BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT
T-Rex: I call them "Benjamin and Mary Jane" and that makes me super rich indeed!
God: AND YOU'RE LEAVING MALFORMED WOMANTS WITH BENEFICIARIES
T-Rex: Yeah, I'll tell you how I fell in love with Ben.
God: AND THEN REPLACED THE GIRL
