T-Rex: Oh crap! Everybody died!
T-Rex: I sit here all day saying ACTUALLY I died, but then I add on the cuss and it's not even funny. I've been drinking and they keep going on about how I'm a communist and how I COULD be a communist!

Utahraptor: What the hell, you guys! You BURY YOUR PEOPLE.
T-Rex: I'm the one who was the one who was poisoned!!

T-Rex: It was the first of July, 1931, and General Electric was the owner of the plants. . . and they were all in communist hands?
Utahraptor: What the hell, you guys! The last person on Earth who controls a nuclear plant and holds the key to a communist future??

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: It's true, everyone on our planet!!
T-Rex: And it was great, because we wouldn't have a communist future!!
