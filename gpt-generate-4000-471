T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!

T-Rex: I will consider it as a public service!

T-Rex: To begin: your house is too small and your car is slightly out of scale! And you! Your colouring is improbable!

T-Rex: You, tiny woman, are too tiny and also lack personality!
Utahraptor: I call shenanigans!

T-Rex: My house is not a parody, it's just a slightly-diffferent version of my house!
Utahraptor: Ah. And your car?

T-Rex: A slightly-diffferent version of yours, of course!
Utahraptor: Do I get it? Yeah, it's a car!
T-Rex: It's a car!
Utahraptor: Well!

T-Rex: I mean, a slightly-diffferent version can be funny, in that it's impossible to be another way.
