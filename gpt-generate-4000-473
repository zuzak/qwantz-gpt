T-Rex: What day of the week is it?  IT'S NOT IMPORTANT, because all that matters is that today it's time for another...

T-Rex: SECRET of the MEDICAL PROFESSION!

T-Rex: Doctors have a difficult job: you come in with symptoms and you expect a diagnosis.  And sometimes that's really hard!  Hate to break it to you, Chuckles, but there's always the chance it's all in your body.
Dromiceiomimus: We've had chlamydias!
T-Rex: There are others.

Utahraptor: Let's hear what you've got to say!
T-Rex: NICEDS?

Utahraptor: Yeah, it's a little thing called "bioassessments".  But it's mostly just a way of saying "I've seen Chuckles!  There's no shame in a good belly"!
T-Rex: Fine.  LET'S share!  NICEDS.
Utahraptor: So what's this mysterious spice called "body horror babe"?

T-Rex: BODY DISAPPOINTMENT CORNER!
T-Rex: No, wait!  This one tastes like skin and you're jealous and you wish you could sex up while holding it.
T-Rex: Not my skin!  This one tastes like burning!
