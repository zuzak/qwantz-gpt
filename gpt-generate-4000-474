T-Rex: I have felt the harsh sting of my own racial joke turned against me! Luckily, I've been saving a joke for just such an occasion.

T-Rex: All of those hours of thinking up insults for hypothetical enemies has finally paid off!

T-Rex: So, my racist joke somehow backfired on me.
Dromeciomimus: I hope that's the last time you ever say that sentence.
T-Rex: Well, I've made up my own joke to get him today. All I need to do is "find that 'er [and' is walking way better now]".

Utahraptor: Find that 'er [and' and] yes!
T-Rex: Find that 'ee [and' and] no!

Utahraptor: It's still not meant to be used in that circumstance.
T-Rex: See? It's not working. It's not fair.
Utahraptor: Find that 'ee [and] and tell him you're going to fix it, okay? It's a slow, incremental death, you know?

Narrator: THAT EVENING...
T-Rex: Can I just say - "I hope you're not all spooked"?
