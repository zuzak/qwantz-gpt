T-Rex: I have come up with a perfect way not to believe in anything wrong ever again.  Evidentialism

T-Rex: A belief is justified only if there is sufficient evidence to support it!

T-Rex: Therefore, I won't believe in anything ever again!  except maybe the absurd and impossible.
T-Rex: Okay!
Dromiceiomimus: But even if you believe the absurd and impossible, does it make you totally rational?
T-Rex: I won't answer that question!  I won't believe that's rational.
T-Rex: Nothing!

Utahraptor: You won't believe in anything, but you'll probably run into lots of weird and spooky things!
T-Rex: Well, I, um, I won't believe in anything.

Utahraptor: Really? You'll still get weird responses like "but ryan's in charge of the ghost claims!"?
T-Rex: Sometimes I think he's a jerk, yes! But I'm not going to accept that as fact!
Utahraptor: I guess!
T-Rex: Yeah, I guess!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX IS A ULTRA-ROTTEN LIEK WITH A SWEETEN COVER!
T-Rex: Hey, what's the matter, my friend? It looks like YOU'VE run into Doug again!
