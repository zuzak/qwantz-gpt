T-Rex: It turns out there's a disease where you cry all of the time! Babies cry all the time, even though they're not born with babies! It's called Babies Caught In A Tiger's Head Or A Moose's Head, and It's For Adults Only.

T-Rex: I call it, "Carnivore Menace"!

T-Rex: It's not that big a deal a problem, but adult tigers AND adults don't cry all the time, and there's a side of us that cries for help. If you don't have a tiger with you, this can be a big problem.
Dromiceiomimus: "I call it, "Carnivore Holmes"!
T-Rex: I know, right? I've always seen it as the biggest baby tiger problem in the world.

Utahraptor: Babies cry, yeah! "It was a big problem, but - well, I guess we've all seen too much of the tiger!"
T-Rex: ...No, I'm busy.
Utahraptor: "Wait, nevermind!"
T-Rex: ... "carnivore holmes?"

T-Rex: "I dunno, an adult tiger could really tear this down. Babies are so small! Sissy-sss!"
Utahraptor: "I'missy-sss! Sissy-sss!"
T-Rex: "I'msojudgy!"
Utahraptor: "I'msojudgy!"
T-Rex: "I'msojudgy!"
