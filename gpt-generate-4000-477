T-Rex: I know that getting a transplant is serious business, and that it can be a traumatic event!

T-Rex: But it's equally important that you prepare for the transplant!

T-Rex: If you rebuild the body too quickly, organ failure can happen! And if you miss the transplant, toxins stored in the organs' connective tissue can build up and kill the people who did it!
T-Rex: That's why doctors are so interested in knowing the exact physiological state of the organ: can they transplant the body, or is it  a multi-step process?

Utahraptor: The exact physiological state of the organ is not totally clear, so it's too for us to draw conclusions!
T-Rex: Yeah, it's a little tricky.

Utahraptor: There's a lot of theories and theories about how things work, but they all seem to be pretty flawed so I don't really know any.
T-Rex: There's really only one way to learn about organ transplants, and that's through examining the bodies of deceased relatives!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dang, there he comes!
T-Rex: This time, I'm a dude who's lived with his ORANGE HANDS.
