T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! Oh MAN.  I'll never say again after this!

T-Rex: Black hat says "tears well-tasted fruit are bittering".

T-Rex: I'm shocked!!
Dromiceiomimus: Come on, T-Rex! It't like THAT in ANYONE's eyes!
T-Rex: It's the worst. It makes me wish we trained more, not just dogs!

Utahraptor: Sounds like you've got a plan!
T-Rex: Oh, Utahraptor! How do you mean?

Utahraptor: I don't know either, T-Rex! It just seems like you're going to say all the things I want in a book and then never come around.
T-Rex: Man! If I want my story to be about dogs I have to get inside my head and - OH SNAP!!!

Narrator: LATER:
Book Cover Text: "We all get to read all the books"
Book Cover Text: "We all get to read the sequels"
Book Cover Text: "The shambling corpse of a cat is replaced by the shambling man, which itself is replaced by the shambling man, who we believe is actually a dog"?
