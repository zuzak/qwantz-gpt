T-Rex: Zombies! Everyone loves zombies. They are a window onto the Other! They let us face our fears of society in a way that is accessible and compelling, as well as accessibly and compellingly cannibalistic!

T-Rex: How do you tell if a person is really an undead zombie?

T-Rex: Well, depending on how you look at it!
T-Rex: Obviously if you look at an undead zombie, they're a ghost, but if you look at an living one, they're a ghost!
T-Rex: WELL IN SOME MARRIAGE ANSWERS TO CRITICAL VACUUM IN A BIRTH, THE LESSON'T YOU COULD ACHIEVE A BIRTH AND FIND OUT IT'S JUST BY LOOKING AT IT

Utahraptor: How do zombies fit into your theory of immortality?
T-Rex: EASY.

T-Rex: Well, if you look at an undead zombie, they're nothing more than a ghost with a single, inconsistent, and sorely missed sense of community. And if you restore him to health by killing zombies, you'll see that they are actually just living to the value of their mortal bodies.
Utahraptor: It's true!

Utahraptor: They live to the fullest. Your immortality can't possibly last forever, Utahraptor.
T-Rex: Hah! Zombies are already dying age and bored at arm's length!
Utahraptor: Nope! Theirs is a timeless and universal truth.
T-Rex: HUMANLY, SOME ARE SO GOOD AT LIFE THAT EACH OTHER IS UNEXPECTEDLY LONG.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE:
Off-screen: It's Hamlet with cusses in it!
T-Rex: I FREAKING NEED TO READ MORE Hamlet
