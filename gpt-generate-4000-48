T-Rex: If I ever build an office building, I'll have the world's most colossal outbuilding, literally!

T-Rex: And if that's somehow necessary every building on Earth to our current position in the universe to be the first in the world to have outgrown building materials (like steel) stop being made, somehow!

Utahraptor: Well every building on Earth that's eventually knocked down is either knocked around or dies.
T-Rex: DAAAANG.

Utahraptor: That's one for the ol' resume, eh?
T-Rex: I know! That's one for the ol' soul. Daaaaaaaaaaaaamn.

T-Rex: But that's the thing! Nobody's knocked down buildings like I am. Building comes naturally to me, right? Like what if this was a case in which all the other buildings of the universe got knocked down?
T-Rex: It would not be an example of this, but all the knockdowns I could eventually come up with were meteor impacts, volcanic eruptions, lesser building falls and so on.
