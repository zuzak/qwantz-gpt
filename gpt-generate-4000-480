T-Rex: I have the best joke for Dromiceiomimus. Boy is I made of flour!

T-Rex: It's flour.

T-Rex: It's like the all-purpose that goes around Dundee, Scotland. And I make it up all the time! For instance, if I make it up all the time, then whenever Dundee comes up, I'll make it up of of myself. Happy? Because it's SO SO SO FAKE.
Dromiceiomimus: That's brilliant, T-Rex! It's so popular that even doctors are doing it, and it seems to have saved thousands of lives every day!

T-Rex: I would also like it to be popular with dentists because it's so great! It gives the new dentist the first solid "you just invented" look, which is a great look and feel. It's great that PEOPLE are using my joke for good reason!
Utahraptor: How do you do it?

T-Rex: Well, I've done it three times, and the third time, I do it often because I'm tired and need to go home.
Utahraptor: Home run. You shot a flapper, incidentally, on your nose.
T-Rex: And home run, I guess, because the result was murder.

T-Rex: Ha! I'd like to see you get all that out, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: If only I could!
T-Rex: I'd like that!
T-Rex: Ha!
