T-Rex: I have been thinking about the murder... and I have not found the key!
God: YOU'VE KILLED THE MURDERER
T-Rex: Huh?

T-Rex: What'd he do? Why was he so unsympathetic? Is there a motive beyond... THE LIVING?
God: FAILED TO SPECIFY THE FACTS
T-Rex: There! That solves my question, and I have no idea why I came up with it!

Utahraptor: What if it's an allegory?
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yeah, I think it's pretty clear that the characters are going to find something new and different, but they're also going to take a different route to getting there. It's not like they had any advice.
T-Rex: FAILED TO SPECIFY THE FACTS? There's only like three or four stories!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX IS A BUTT:
T-Rex: Hey God, is there a superhero that goes by?
God: YEP
T-Rex: Wow! Hmmm... I think we should give that superhero a try.
God: THE THREESOME POWER OF GLOBAL NURSE
