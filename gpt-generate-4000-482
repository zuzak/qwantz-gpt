T-Rex: Hey God, is there a way we can get people to pay more for sex we haven't seen or heard of?
God: LISTEN T-REX
T-Rex: The answer is "YES, please!"

T-Rex: This is one way of living that I can accept, as long as you're not going to make me pay for it.

Narrator: SEX IS NOW HAVING PROBLEMS BY LEVITROUS:
T-Rex: And... WHAT?
Utahraptor: Someone's breaking into their house and shooting people out of windows, and then what?

Utahraptor: The police are investigating. Hopefully it's some guy... who's good at things like that. Maybe there's a way we can turn this into a positive event and made local news.
T-Rex: NOBODY DO THIS!
Utahraptor: I think that's impossible!  Doesn't work!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX IS A STRANGER AND ANGLER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Today I learned why we don't see people who are lasses.
T-Rex: It comes from the Latin phrase meaning "a stranger in a room with you", which originally meant "someone who makes you feel sexy".
T-Rex: AND it's French for "sexue", which means "a lady who wears a thong, dear friends"!
