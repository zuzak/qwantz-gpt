T-Rex:  Hello and welcome to Spider-Fan, the #1 talk show for fans of Spider-Man.  What's New On The Program:  Spider-Man.

T-Rex:  Today's Topic:  Why do ghosts like to fight?

T-Rex:  As we all know, ghosts do EVERYTHING they're told, and they do it really well.  They're among the first things to be communicated.  Here's why:  they're pissed off at something or someone!  They don't know why, but they're all hell or high again!
Dromiceiomimus:  Or maybe they're pissed off at... RACISTS?
T-Rex:  I've got my own idea about it!

Utahraptor:  What do ghosts do?
T-Rex:  They wrap ropes around themselves, and then they go!

Utahraptor:  And then they go back to their own lives and blow up walls or whatever.  And SOMEONE gets hurt and they get mad at the same person and say "I'm sure it was you, my friend!  I'm sure it was SO MANY hurt and ghosts.  This makes me really sad."
T-Rex:  The end!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE PARK:
T-Rex:  Excuse me, sir, you look like you're having trouble with discrimination.  Why are you being silent?
Sir:  Because I said you're having a problem!  You're a man in the sub-nethere!  Who are you to criticise the very fabric of reality?
T-Rex:  I am!  And you're only as good as your beliefsINE (or rather, its inhabitants)OEM!
