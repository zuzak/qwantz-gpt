T-Rex: With the right clothes, you can dress up fancy; you can look both super adorable AND ready to go.

T-Rex: Just like Batman!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, do you think fashion is so easy to get into?
Dromiceiomimus: I think so, T-Rex!  It can be hard to find the perfect suit!
T-Rex: I finally did it!  I've got this... suit.

Utahraptor: You're going to need it, T-Rex!
T-Rex: So?

Utahraptor: Yeah!  It can be tricky to get the hang of it.  Where do you want to go with your visor?
T-Rex: There's this one storey you can call if you're feeling ambitious.
Utahraptor: But not too hard!  I got the hang of it.

T-Rex: If you want to go a little challenge, I've got a cool way to do it.
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus!
T-Rex: That's what I said!
