T-Rex: Who here wants to watch me eat a sandwich?
God: SURE
T-Rex: Dude, it's

Narrator: Hours later:
T-Rex: I feel fine!

T-Rex: I think I'll go eat some bread.  It tastes good, even though it's not bread.
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe I want to come with you to a special market for the poor guy.
T-Rex: Oh man!  Why did I taste like bread? Did I use the Fed up at the market?  Or should I say, have I failed to show appreciation for the product?

Utahraptor: I like it!  Is it because it has a heart-shaped heart with holes for food?
T-Rex: What?

Utahraptor: It's just a stupid sign!  If it had a heart-shaped heart, I would eat it.  Why would I take a stupid sign home when I could take it home with me and cook?
T-Rex: IT'S WHY.

Narrator: SPECIAL THANKS TO EVERYONE FOR BEING EXTRA EXTRA EXTRA EXTRA STICK TOO
Narrator: THE END
