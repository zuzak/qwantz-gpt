T-Rex: It's been what - four thousand years of civilization? Five thousand? How come we haven't solved all the problems and answered all the questions?

T-Rex: I think, as a people, we have kind of dropped the ball!

T-Rex: I think we've lost the way of the man, cats and kittens!  We've lost the way of the Divine!  I don't know much about Cats and kittens, but I know they're all about settling personal tastes, which are never going to be your thing.
Dromiceiomimus: I think I know how to fix that, T-Rex! You know how to fix people liking you, and I'm not going to stand by and let someone get by?

Utahraptor: I guess I look forward to solving all our problems, T-Rex, but not everyone can get to know you!
T-Rex: What? You look forward to the day when everyone is rad, no matter what your problems are.
Utahraptor: Right!

Utahraptor: Just like, say, say, what would Zach Morris be better off without? His sweet tooth.  A little boy who wants something done, but he can't.  And a aging body to live off.  So he tries OutCitye, which is basically his old living, and it's mostly just NSFW word choices.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Morris, you're seen in this comic, aged just like me!
Morris: yeah, but I'm way older than you!
T-Rex: Yeah, but I'm still just a kid in the role! I'm bigger than everyone!
Morris: but I've still got some friends who are even better than me!
T-Rex: I know!
