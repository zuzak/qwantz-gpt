T-Rex: What is exorcism for? Banishing demons back to hell, right?
God: NO T-REX WHAT STORIES DO YOU NEED TO KNOW

T-Rex: Well, here's what we do...

T-Rex: Um, OBVIOUSLY EVERYTHING?

T-Rex: Except ex-offenders! I see them as enemies, and I don't want to remove them from the story, okay? They're still friends, even if they start out as equals. I don't want to remove them from the story!
Dromiceiomimus: Well, you faced such a situation - with a demons guy! You exorcised him!
T-Rex: He tried to fight it, but in exorcisms he has to be the one fighting it!

Utahraptor: So he goes down in history, but how does he do it?
T-Rex: I don't know! It's more of a feeling than a cause!

Utahraptor: Well, he SUCKED. He exorcises demons with PURITY, no? He has a BACKUP: he has to be alive every time 2000 people turn to him for help.
T-Rex: Argh!  I call shenanigans!!

God: BUT YOU KNOW WHAT T-REX IT'S LIKE BECAUSE OF THE EXPANDED HIDDEN ADVICE THAT DEFINITELY BEGAN BECOMING INTEREST
T-Rex: I dunno! I mean, it was fun, and it helped me realize I don't want to get married and have kids and then have the whole "abandoned and infatuated" thing happen.
God: HONESTLY
God: IT'S THE WORST
