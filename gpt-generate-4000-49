T-Rex: I just realized that if the universe lasts forever - infinitely forever - then anything that CAN happen WILL happen! It has to because of infinite time!

T-Rex: Infinite time! Kick ASS!

Dromiceiomimus: But T-Rex, isn't the current scientific thinking that the universe will expand forever, but in doing so become a lifeless frozen expanse just above absolute zero due to increases in entropy?
T-Rex: But Dromiceiomimus - infinite time! That means that there won't be any Genesis or Eve days, just the routine stuff of today.

Utahraptor: You're saying the universe will last forever?
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: And just like the regular universe, EVERYTHING that works in the universe will eventually fail, and that means there'll be infinitely many days until we run out of electricity and start again.
Utahraptor: Wow, you sure have been quiet on that one. I really thought it would be more complicated than that.

T-Rex: I!!
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: I've got a whole new understanding of the universe that Iingly applies it to every issue!
