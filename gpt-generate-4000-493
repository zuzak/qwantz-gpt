T-Rex: What if we had children at an earlier time?

T-Rex: NO PROBLEM!  We could have kids TODAY.

T-Rex: But we already have FULLY POPULAR kids.  I just thought it was more that we've been trained to expect children of WEAKENLY parents to do.
Dromiceiomimus: I think you're making a very symbolic marriage to the job of raising a child.  How much of a symbolic marriage does raising a child truly deserve I don't know.  I can't just decide to be a grandmother all on my own.

Utahraptor: I think raising a child is a whole other level of symbolic than raising a child.
T-Rex: Yeah!  I raise my child in a way that I can't possibly imagine.

T-Rex: It's the ultimate level of level, Utahraptor.  I'm not sure I can do it with things happening in another person's life that I can't possibly imagine!  Not to mention all of my friends will probably be TOTALLY INVITED to me for raising a child.
Utahraptor: Wow.  I'm really sorry T-Rex, but I think you should be.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE FUTURE:
T-Rex: raising child on my own terms, with the knowledge that everyone will be OLD by the time I'm 80.
