T-Rex: I have been thinking about it and it has made me very sad! Things are gonna be great out there in the future, but I don't have a great imagination for it.

T-Rex: I'm kinda imagining all sorts of things in my imagination, even imagining me and my ideas for them in my imagination!

T-Rex: For instance, I'm gonna write a story where I eat a lot of sandwiches. Then later on I'm gonna go and say "Wow, I'm no good at eating, okay?  Now I feel bad about that."
T-Rex: "I feel bad about that" kind of feeling.

Utahraptor: Another good idea is auteur's art!  Use it to create haunting images in your head!
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: Use your soul to create images that are at once haunting and art!  Use it to create beautiful music and then set up your songs in the style of Ho Chi Minh and then chorus throughout the song that is about you and the many lives you leave behind.
Utahraptor: That is pretty much every song in the entire album!

T-Rex: Hooray for art and memory!
