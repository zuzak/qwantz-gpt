T-Rex: Shoot! I just accidentally spoke too much Russian on hold and I have to go.

T-Rex: Can I talk to you in English?

T-Rex: Not unless I want to speak in French! But MAN, I'd rather just have a good time with my friends in English than in some huffy French class.
Dromiceiomimus: What are you doing here, T-Rex? You liked French so much you somehow missed out on the victory!
T-Rex: That's not a problem! I just thought it was just a 50% chance.

Utahraptor: Man, that just means you're wrong on a PR coup!
T-Rex: Not a problem, man!

Utahraptor: Well, that's not a bad thing, because I think you should be taking a look: wrongness in a friend, right? And you should look at your problems in French instead, because I'm still thinking of you and I'm thinking of both Russian. What's more, if you were to sum it up in a sentence, you'd better call it "You're right, of course!"
T-Rex: That's not a problem! WHAT IS

Narrator: Russian Problem Solving Time; Two Ws: French!
T-Rex: Hooray for rightness!
Utahraptor: I'll come over tonight to solve the problem. You can't go wrong with wrongness.
T-Rex: Oh yeah?
T-Rex: For a first date, two Ws!
