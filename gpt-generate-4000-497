T-Rex: Poker sure seems to be popular lately! Does the road to financial independence TRULY pass through Gambling Towne, USA?

God: THE ANSWER IS NO
T-Rex: There's one way to find out!

God: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING T-REX I'M NOT GIVING A WHOLE THING T-REX I'M GIVING A WHOLE THING
God: YOU'RE KINDA KINDA Dromiceiomimus THIS Is What It's Like To Be A Guy In A Poker Face And Also Winning Other Poker GAMES
T-Rex: Huh?

Utahraptor: The problem with Gambling Towne is that you always end up with something way less bad, T-Rex! There's no reason to make a game where you face off in a board game with other people, right?
T-Rex: There's only one way to go about it!

Utahraptor: Well, actually, the other way is best. You should play GINGER COMICS, and that makes Gambling Towne the best board game ever.
T-Rex: It's not as good as the one you played
Utahraptor: Seriously!
T-Rex: I could've played a better game, for example, if I'd been more into the fact that I could bluff my way into the top 8!
