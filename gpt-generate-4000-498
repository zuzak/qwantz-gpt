T-Rex: What if I made a story about a superhero who, for some reason, never gets tired?
God: THAT'S FOR TWO THINS
T-Rex: TWO THINS

God: NO I DIDN'T THAT COME SOONER

T-Rex: Aha! But THAT'S the problem with most superhero stories: they're too long and focused on making things suck, and they rely on readers not knowing anything at all! How could a story about a cat that NEVER DOES GET TICKED BACK be anything but a short story?
God: PRAYERS FOR THE READER

T-Rex: Oh, good ol' God, I pray of your not being a sucky dude! I don't wanna suck!
Utahraptor: Hey you!

T-Rex: Aww, listen, listen, I really need to hear back to you later. Maybe I'll write a better story about a grizzly bear with solid art direction and puns!
Utahraptor: Aww, good buddy!
T-Rex: Aww oh my God!

God: T-REX WINS AGAIN
T-Rex: I don't need this again bear lover!
Utahraptor: You're not needed!
T-Rex: Sorry but GOD DAMNED, I was just fooling.

{{title text: unlike stories where the characters don't actually get tired, here we get flash back stories where they find a home... SOMETHING.  like... love... everywhere.}}
