T-Rex: Anyway!  Relationships are for the young and the criminally insane.  What's of real importance is that I saw a car dealership ad yesterday advertising that "no reasonable offer will be refused"!

T-Rex: Well, yeah!

T-Rex: Oooh, ads like that burn my biscuits.  Of course they're not going to refuse a reasonable offer!  That's what makes it so reasonable!  And worse, since "reasonable" can be a very subjective word, it's not really saying anything beyond "Hey, I won't refuse an offer for reasons that I personally find irrational."

Utahraptor: It sounds like you've put a lot of thought into this, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's a thought fueled by anger!

T-Rex: It's ridiculous!  And it bothers me because it sounds like you're personally angry.  Would you rather be angry than refuse a reasonable offer?
Utahraptor: It's a good question!  And I'm gonna do it!

Narrator: BACK AT HOME...
T-Rex: Home, I hear you'll say "no" to my ad again!
T-Rex: Angry!
T-Rex: And that's where my ad comes from!
