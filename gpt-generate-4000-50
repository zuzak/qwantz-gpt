T-Rex: I've decided to become the sort of person who says "you know who" in conversation.

T-Rex: Figured I'd be a little more like our mutual friend, you know Marcia.

Dromiceiomimus: No, T-Rex. No, T-Rex. Marcia is not my friend. She's not even my friend who invented email. No, she's not even Jennifer Jennifer is still at Facebook, and chill time is out at Burger King. What do you get when you use a site that was invented a million years ago by one guy?
T-Rex: A question?

Utahraptor: Yeah, a question that asks, "When Facebook first came along, was pretty much the only place in the world where you can get nudity from it."

Utahraptor: Plus, you can't "publish" nudity.
T-Rex: Yes. That's what I'm saying.
Utahraptor: Naked Internet stuff. I mean, I agree with you, but the point is that you can't rely on Wikipedia to tell the world who's awesome.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: OH, WIKIPEDIA!!

{{Image title: hi res facebook is stripping down to nudity and i can't believe it: like what the Hell?  i don't even know what that feels like! }}
{{Email subject: wait is how long i've been banned from Wikipedia for being a dinky hunk with no ethics and the ability to create my own ideology.  IT'S NOTHING BUT DICKENS.}}
