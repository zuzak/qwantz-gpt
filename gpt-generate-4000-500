T-Rex: David Hilbert was a mathematician and hotelier who was born in 1892.  He built a bridge that is still standing today.

Narrator: THE ENGLISH LITTLE ADVENTURE

T-Rex: Then he solved the law of commutator motion, which is, of course, the problem of every living person ever!
Dromiceiomimus: Oh okay!
T-Rex: In conclusion, Hilbert built a bridge that is still standing today.

Utahraptor: What really happened in Hilbert's time?
T-Rex: What really?

Utahraptor: What really?  As time went on and Hilbert built more and more bridges, he realized he had a large number of modern advances in his bridge design.  What he needed was a simple and efficient means of travel.
T-Rex: He invented calculus!
Utahraptor: Ah, but that makes you a creepy old man with a bayonet for absents.

T-Rex: It did though!  It finally made him a household name, and it also raised the bar!  What if I want a drink and I can't find one at my local restaurant?  What if I order a "hugetastic" steaks-on-cork steaks, named after the "hugetastic steaks" that made regular old me lunch-style?

T-Rex: Utahraptor!  We can't make tacos for 25 dollars.
T-Rex: You can't make tacos for 25 dollars!
T-Rex: You can't make tacos for 25 dollars!
