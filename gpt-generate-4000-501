T-Rex: What if I worked productively and creatively towards achieving my goals today?

T-Rex: That is the beauty of life!

T-Rex: If I worked harder, creatively and tactically, I could supercharge my accomplishments, and I could be HUNDREDS of years into a sustained, sustainable, and happy existence.
Dromiceiomimus: That's not impossible, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Whether or not you're successful as a professional, you know that there's a price we can't go to without your friendship.

Utahraptor: Those of you who have left work early might have hit their head on the stairs, my friend!
T-Rex: Don't look at me like that!

Utahraptor: Yeah, those guys are going to jail.
T-Rex: I know!
Utahraptor: I'm not so sure.

T-Rex: Well, that's exactly what I decided not to look at those guys later, while you were still awake.
T-Rex: The real question comes from this old joke I made where somebody reads a book and reminds you later, "That book was way more fun to read."
