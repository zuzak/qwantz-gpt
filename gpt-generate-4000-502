T-Rex: "Antonio Tony and Amelia wake up in a world where suddenly everyone has gone blind! This world is overrun with DEITIES: incorporeal good, but also cursed giants! They have taken over the world and are running things inside it! It's a very particular kind of chaos, and I'm really glad I know this country!"

T-Rex: "It's a very particular kind of chaos, and I'm really glad I know this country!"

T-Rex: "It's really unusual for a 17th century work of literature to be so obsessed with its own sexism! It's like Dunno, but it's like DEFINITELY awesome."
Utahraptor: "It's the 1920s, and the whole canon is re-edited like it's the 20s!"

Utahraptor: "It's the 20s, and everyone's wearing swimsuits and boobs and exuberant beauty is wa-huming in the 30s!"
T-Rex: "It's the 20s, and everyone's talking about how the future is so awesome and awesome has a lot of power and I hate to be the one to say it out loud."

T-Rex: "It's the 20s, and everyone's talking about how the city's hot and they get really excited about going inside!!"
Utahraptor: "It's the 20s, and there's this accordor chant to the hymn, only he has a cooler fave for the accordor chant!"
T-Rex: "It's the 20s, and he holds the tiny accordion in his arms and sings the beat of his heart!"
Utahraptor: "It's the 20s, and he's dead hot into the horn!"

T-Rex: "It's the 20s, and this guy just happens to be silent and sounds like he's having a hard time ignoring all the stares!"
Utahraptor: "It's the 20th, and the artist is TERRIFIED, and the reason is probably because every famous person is now a corpse, because the audience ison pointlessly murdered, and the audience dies as soon as the story ends."

T-Rex: "It's the 22nd, and the audience is KILLING the artist in question, Dying Without Life."
Utahraptor: "It's the 22nd, and the author is a TERRIFER."
T-Rex: "Oh man, I can't wait."
