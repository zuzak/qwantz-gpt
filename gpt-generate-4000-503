T-Rex: Are you a human? Are you pretty chuffed about that whole scene in which you're somehow made out of different parts of the same species?
T-Rex: I -

T-Rex: WELL, for a second I was worried the audience might think humans were made out of different parts of the same species.  But I don't care!

T-Rex: We're all different species, Dromiceiomimus. We have different body colours and we have different body hair.  We're happy just like we are, and I think that's really cool.
Dromiceiomimus: Dromiceiomimus, you're so happy just like me.  I love finding out more about Dromiceiomimian happy.
T-Rex: We are.  We're so happy.

Utahraptor: What if all of the human characters had been made out of different parts of the same plant?
T-Rex: Oh man!

Utahraptor: OH WOW.  OH WOW I LITERALLY GOT YOU THAT WAY ALL THE TIME.
T-Rex: You don't hear that?
Utahraptor: It's the sound of my voice!  Just make it seem like I'm making it, you know?
Utahraptor: It's pretty okay with you, T-Rex.

T-Rex: Hello?  And um, I'll make you a sandwich.  A sandwich that tastes like more than one person but that tastes EVEN MORE like suckiness.
T-Rex: Okay!  And then maybe a cheese.  A sucky sandwich.
