T-Rex: Oh crap, has it been four years? That means World Cup Football has been played for all of time! And it also means we've got an epibition of what our generation will be like in fifty years!

T-Rex: And it also means, "I wonder what things would be like if Augustus Skynet wasn't my brother."

Dromiceiomimus: That doesn't sound like what you mean, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Oh, it's embarrassing! Look, I know I sound like a guy who is down for a big ol' party, but I just sounded like a totally embarrassed and embarrassed Dromiceiomimus.
Dromiceiomimus: I don't think you do either of those things anymore!
T-Rex: ...What?

Utahraptor: Yeah, I think you're making the wrong joke, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Hah! I'm just trying to figure out how to say "I wonder what things would be like if Augustus Skynet wasn't my brother".

Utahraptor: Yeah, I guess he would be an old man by now, but not if he wasn't in favour of slavery.
T-Rex: ...Oh.
Utahraptor: You don't believe he's an old man? Is he still around?

T-Rex: He is certainly a guy who decided in the past to get old!
T-Rex: I would like to contribute my thoughts, perhaps with some insight, into society?
