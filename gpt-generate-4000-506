T-Rex: Okay, so Herostratus burned down the Temple of Artemis. But what happened to the other wonders of the World? My friends, I ask a bold question: indeed, the boldest.

T-Rex: And the answer is simple:

T-Rex: YES, THE ANSWER IS STILL NOT TRUE.

T-Rex: The Persians and the Greeks tried to fight them, but the Persians couldn't resist, and they were about to! So, what happened?
T-Rex: Well, the Persians won! But the Greeks were actually quite effective at sneakpeeks! They called it, "A DAY OF EXTREME EXPERTISE" - oops, that was actually my full thought process while typing that sentence!

Utahraptor: The victory was a little... a lot of horse races!
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: But, it made things interesting for ME, because... during the day when I'm typing this sentence, all I see are the crazy words I didn't think I knew were worth mentioning!
Utahraptor: Horses!
T-Rex: Horses!
Utahraptor: They're not what they sound like.

Narrator: AT THE WEDDING:
T-Rex: The horse raced past my post and up to my house and down to its north pole!
The Barrie Farmer: Who were you chatting up, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I was chatting up a woman!
The Farmer: HORSES
