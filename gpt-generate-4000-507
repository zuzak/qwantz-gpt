Narrator: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ETHICS AND MORALS
Narrator: hey adults! put me in your wallet!

T-Rex: Ethics and morals are not the same thing!

T-Rex: I know! That's why you've got so much controversy and always have problems! But really, ethics are more interesting because you look at one's friends and/or enemies and say "They're an awful lot of bad, I think." That's what ethics do! It gives you an excuse to be CLEARLY ethical even though everyone you know is probably secretly really just your own worst enemy! It's great if you think other people's ethics are more important than yours!

Utahraptor: Oh great, great! My friend, I feel like I'm living the hardest life you've ever seen, and it's not because I have any problems!
T-Rex: Aw man! Really?

T-Rex: But I worry I'm letting my ethical high ground become a race between me and the never-ending battle for scarce and affordable abortion access!
Utahraptor: It's good to be back! I look forward to seeing you!
T-Rex: Ah yes!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Wow, that was EXCELLENT, eh, everyone? That was a pretty good day for an excuse to be classy!
T-Rex: It was a good day for an excuse to be classy!
