T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! Oh MAN.  I'll never say this again.

T-Rex: IMPOSSIBLE WISHES

T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! SO MEANWHILE, OLDER NEWS CENTER: a series of nine titles - all about the exploits of a young man named... T-Rex!
T-Rex: Two words: IMPOSSIBLE!

Utahraptor: Wait, now I'm looking like you're not, Utahraptor, my friend!
T-Rex: Two words: UTAHRAPTOR

Utahraptor: Wait - looks like this is all a crazy ruse to get you elected to congress! What am I going to do?
T-Rex: Two words: I AM NOT REALLY SURE IF THEY'RE EVEN REAL
Utahraptor: ...I think it's clear you're not really that good a politician.

T-Rex: Man, you're totally looking to get change back in the eyes of the beholder! On the other hand, I think it's pretty clear you've just got to beierraved.
Utahraptor: Aw, T-Rex!
Utahrapror: Can we talk about commercials?
T-Rex: Uh...yes?
