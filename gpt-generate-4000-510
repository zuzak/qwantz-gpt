T-Rex: I have compiled a list of people I enjoy seeing! A list, if you will...

T-Rex: ... of my friends!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, you are on my list of friends!
Dromiceiomimus: Um - thanks?
T-Rex: Think nothing of it!

Narrator: BACKSTORY: T-REX HAS BEEN TAKING A SEXIER PLACE IN HIS LIFE...
Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex!

T-Rex: What's this? I was talking about you.
Utahraptor: Oh, I was just making sure you know how I feel.
T-Rex: I... don't know. Wow. That's just how things are.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, it's true!

T-Rex: I'm glad you found my list of friends interesting. I guess I've just had a good run!
Utahraptor: Sounds like a good time.
T-Rex: Oh, I'm glad you found me attractive. I guess I've just had a good run!
