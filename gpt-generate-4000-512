T-Rex: I have the greatest idea for a movie!  I've said this before but this time it's for serious.  There's this cop, right?

T-Rex: Right!

T-Rex: And he's a "by-the-books" cop who has a secret identity, but nobody knows him and he's hiding out in the real world.  So in the movie "By The Books" he's a different kind of cop, doing other things (resting, eating salad instead of salad)!  Then in the real one he's a undercover detective who does "by the books".

Utahraptor: So the movie has this "By The Books" motif, but in a more practical sense, there's no book called "By The Books"?
T-Rex: Nope!

Utahraptor: It's more practical, anyway.  By the books are more used by the police, but they still get a good reputation.  By the books are revealed to be just administrative laziness!
T-Rex: It's true!  That means no real-life superheroes from history times to the present day!

T-Rex: NOBODY uses the word "By The Books" anymore!
T-Rex: I'm serious!  It's absurd!
