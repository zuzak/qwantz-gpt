Narrator: COMPRESSED ORIGIN STORY COMICS
Narrator: Today's origin story: SPIDER-MAN
T-Rex: I'm Midtown High's only professional wallflower!

T-Rex: Long ago, spiders too had sex!

T-Rex: Incredible, you guys!

T-Rex: There's so many awesome stories about these spiders, and here I am, in my own skin, saying that there was an even greater spider-filled floor than there is now. The only thing I'm not sure is if this is real life, or if this was an elaborate prank, or if this was just some crazy dream I had. Whatever the case, I do hereby proclaim this to be "The Amazing "Spider-Invented" Book of the Day".

Utahraptor: And the reason this is important is that this was an elaborate prank, and there's no way you could tell by looking at it how good it was.
T-Rex: That's what I'm saying!

Utahraptor: But I can tell a good joke too. I think it's pretty great. I think you've got what it takes to be a street-worthy hero!
T-Rex: Oh, I know! Inflation, I mean. I'm not sure how I know what Spider-Man is into.

T-Rex: Oh, that's great! Then settle things then, I'm sure of it!
Narrator: THE END
