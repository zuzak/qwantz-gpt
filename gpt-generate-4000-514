T-Rex: I don't have a son, but if I did, I'd have no idea what to name him.

T-Rex: But I've got great names for everyone else's hypothetical sons!

T-Rex: For example, Dromiceiomimus, if YOU had a son, a great name for him would be DromiceioHEmus. Eh? ...Since he's a man, I thought we should emphasize that in his name.
Dromiceiomimus: Thank you, T-Rex! I appreciate it.

Utahraptor: Okay, what if I had a son...WHO WAS ALSO A DOG?
T-Rex: Nice try, Utahraptor!

T-Rex: You're trying to trip me up here but I'm ALSO rad at dog names; your dog will be named after the Star Trek physician and be called "Doctor McCoy".
Utahraptor: That's a bit rand-
T-Rex: "Bones" for short.
T-Rex & Utahraptor: NICE.

T-Rex: If nobody else will say it, I will!
T-Rex: THAT WAS AN EXTREMELY EXCELLENT NAME FOR A DOG.
T-Rex: I know I failed to take dog names into account when I decided to rename my dog "T-Rex" but that still hurts!
