T-Rex: I have been thinking, and I have come up with a winning formula for judging both good and bad writing.

T-Rex: For instance!

T-Rex: one might expect a writing regime of this size to favour either good or medium-sized books. In fact, I think this is true! I think a medium-sized book will more easily be described as a collection of single- or multi-storey houses.
T-Rex: A few examples: Sally Struthers, 18 books; Jane Austen, MACBETH, Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets.

Utahraptor: And The Lord of the Rings?
T-Rex: And Harry Potter?

Utahraptor: Yep! And where did the Harry Potter gene come from? A site on the moon that was discovered over three years ago.
T-Rex: I don't know, maybe it was in the MP3s. Maybe it was encoded into the MP3 player in the original computer!
Utahraptor: Huh. Maybe the sound was altered?

T-Rex: Further research is necessary.
Utahraptor: The moon has been studied for years. They're getting pretty sick at the moment!
T-Rex: I've already driven around the parts of the world that have never been seen, but it's still 3 million kilometers away.
T-Rex: I've got no more secrets!
