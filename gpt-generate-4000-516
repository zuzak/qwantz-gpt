T-Rex: Who here wants to watch me eat a sandwich?
God: YOU'RE ON
T-Rex: WHY WOULD YOU DESCRIBE ME IF YOU DESPERATE IT

Narrator: LET'S EAT FOOD IN MY CAR
Narrator: JUST ONE QUESTION:
T-Rex:  If I ate food in your car, would you destroy your sandwich?
Dromiceiomimus:  Sure!  I would not.
T-Rex:  I would, and would you rather not!!

Utahraptor:  Why not try this out?
T-Rex:  We'll meet the day after my death...

Utahraptor:  And be sure to subscribe to my email newsletter! I will be updating this message board with new tastings!
T-Rex:  YOU WILL BE THANKING ME later!
Utahraptor:  THE END

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE...
T-Rex:  Oooh, I should've added "spoiled apple factory" when I could say "Here, you know what I've got'n'?
T-Rex:  A cake it's got crust!
T-Rex:  And I GUESS if I ate it I'd get excited a lot!
