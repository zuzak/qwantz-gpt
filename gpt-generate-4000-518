T-Rex: I have noticed that eating different foods has different physiological effects on myself. There must be some 'balanced diet' that maximizes the agreeable effects of such nourishment!

T-Rex: However, as I already discovered, there are easily identifiable health benefits of eating such foods!

T-Rex: For instance, Ionectivex is a protein synthesized from the hair follicles of the cephalopod family, which is related to the skin.  It is composed of DRI-3,4,5,6 and arachidonic acid, which are also home to many important blood elements.  Interestingly, Ionectivex has also been shown to block out the visible spectrum radiation, a property that people with sensitive skin may find to be OFFENSIVE.

Utahraptor: And you're experimenting with food irradiated by LEXISIA?
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: What she's doing is called a "persona dose" and it has her name attached to it.  It's basically about rescuing the girl you love from a radiation exposure you can't get or keep.  But she's a radiation exposure Bunny.  You have to feed her BLEEDON'S BODY.
Utahraptor: So she's a radiation exposure Behemoth.
T-Rex: Yep!  The radiation stays with her and when you run out of food, she runs away, but her stomach still produces enough radiation to make you immune!  You're a mammal now, and your body has immunity, so you can fight for your life.

T-Rex: And she's a mammal now too, pretty sweet.
