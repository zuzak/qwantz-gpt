Narrator: DINOSAUR COMICS
T-Rex: Dinosaurs were giant ferocious lizards!

T-Rex: They were a constant threat to everyone around them!  They were known to destroy human property with impunity!

T-Rex: Dinosaurs were also known to destroy human LIFE with impunity!
Utahraptor: I notice you're using the past tense!

T-Rex: Yes.  I'm experimenting with it.
Utahraptor: You're experimenting with using inappropriate verb tenses.
T-Rex: Yes I am.  I decide to use this new, less awkward "it happened" expression!

T-Rex: And it went so well!  I knew I'd want to do something like this again after I'd left school.  I was all, "It happened!"
T-Rex: ...I think I might have unfinished business here.  Why not?
