T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! Oh MAN.  I'll never work that out.

T-Rex: I'd be amazing!

T-Rex: I'd have so much potential! There's only so many science fiction and fantasy books, and that's for sure.  But what happens when I keep reading?  You can never have a story about TRANSITING TALK back to an earlier time!
Dromiceiomimus: You can never have a story about curing diseases!)
T-Rex: I can!

Utahraptor: Well, what if I transformed all communication between time and "space" into mechanical and otherwise impossible things?
T-Rex: For our universe.

Utahraptor: Yeah, but this isn't actually a story about how time travel is possible.  This is a story about how I wish I were back in my own time, but am no longer!"
T-Rex: Anyway.  I have a better idea.
Utahraptor: What happens if you send BACK TIME TO INVENT POTENTIAL MASS?

T-Rex: And what happens if you send BACK POTENTIAL MASS?
Utahraptor: Futurism!  Adult novelism!
T-Rex: Futurism where you fight to the death to the death to the death!
Utahraptor: The ending is so awesome!
Utahraptor: YEP.
