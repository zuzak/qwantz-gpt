T-Rex: I feel my life is ending, and I don't know what to tell you.

T-Rex: Oh no!

T-Rex: I can't, on account of how I feel?  Oh no!  My life is ending, and I don't know what to tell you!
Dromiceiomimus: What do you mean by that?  It seems like a good time to me to give you some advice!
T-Rex: No problem!
T-Rex: Give me your hand!

Utahraptor: Effective, huh?
T-Rex: Okay, but I still think you should give me your hand.

Utahraptor: Do you really want to spend all this money on a corset, T-Rex?
T-Rex: obviously not!
Utahraptor: Are you saying I'm spending all this money on a barely-functional Second Life moment?
T-Rex: No, just...
Utahraptor: Yes, well, that doesn't make sense.

T-Rex: OH MY GOD, WHAT WAS THAT VOICE THINKING IF I DID SAY YES
T-Rex: AND THEN SUDDENLY I'M DOING THE EXACT THING I DID
T-Rex: ...Huh.
