T-Rex: "Antonio Tony and Amelia wake up in a world where suddenly everyone has gone blind!"

T-Rex: "It seems that everyone's having recurring dreams that are completely ridiculous. Antonio and Amelia turn to each other and whisper 'Oh sheesh, everyone has had recurring dreams this morning' and now they're having DEPRESSED CONSUMERS. Antonio turns to run to the door and locked it behind him!"

Utahraptor: Run!
T-Rex: It's better, T-Rex!

T-Rex: "They hold up their hand to signal their response to the sound of another door slamming into their door. Soon everyone is talking in the same spot and their mouths are open - only you can move to look."
Utahraptor: T-Rex it's a nightmare!! We should go.
T-Rex: Please! Do you hear it? "We're going"?!

Utahraptor: No! We're sleeping in the same bed we've been sleeping in for the past several hours, and if you don't move, we'll wake up another person!
