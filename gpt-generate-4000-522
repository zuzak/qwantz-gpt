T-Rex: Okay, so nobody has bought my Tuggy story. THIS IS THEIR LOSS. Tuggy and I love her. This is our story!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: But that's the thing with plots: EVERYBODY HAS ONE!
T-Rex: I just thought it was a chance to SMOOCH over here and see if I could figure out a way to celebrate her.

Utahraptor: You're not going to do that?
T-Rex: Sure! But I'm not going to make a donation to a charity just to make a T-Rex's birthday happen.

Utahraptor: But you would be violating charity law, with your gesture!
T-Rex: Still! I have nothing less to do!

T-Rex: And that brings me to my original point: everyone loves a nice little cheque, and I don't want to hear anyone's voice a rousing shriek of "All is lost!"
T-Rex: So oh, great, we've been discovered and we're still alive. This is the end of everything I've gained by making only one thing seem cool and charming and make it seem like nobody cares! This was once my chance to make a difference and have it now ended by mistake!

T-Rex: I'm out. I'm seen as a terrible friend. I'm discredited.
Utahraptor: I'm not sure how you feel about such a fate.
T-Rex: I do believe that you will be forgiven!
Utahraptor: That's been done?
T-Rex: WITH KNOWN DEFENSEMEN
