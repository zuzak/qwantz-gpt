T-Rex: Everyone!
T-Rex: Guess what?

T-Rex: I am NOT THAT SURE what's going on!

T-Rex: I don't think that anyone is really sure what's going on, either!  I don't think that dressing modestly or being modest about certain things has any bearing on what goes on in your life!
T-Rex: I don't think that dressing modestly is any better than dressing in a standard clothesline!  It has an entirely different feel to me.

Utahraptor: You're dressing modestly, T-Rex!
T-Rex: That's the point!

Utahraptor: Yeah man!  It makes me feel a little more like I'm about to have a conversation than I actually am.  I don't want to have to explain what's going on in my life.  It's a little confusing!
T-Rex: It's a little confusing, but I guess we're doing it right!  I'm dedicating my life to making sure that no matter what, the people I know and love don't really get a raise!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX IS MAKING ALL THE SOUNDS OF "DROMICEIOMIMUS" ALL CONFESSED:
T-Rex: Oh hah hah!  So much for that pun, Phoebe!  And her mom!
T-Rex: Is that alright?
