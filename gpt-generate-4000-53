T-Rex: Back in the time of History, how on Earth did we fall into civilization?  Answer this hilarious letter from Sherlock Holmes, addressed to his "metacarpuncle" Moriarty!

T-Rex: And now, he's going to find out why we don't all like to eat brains anymore!

T-Rex: And he's not the only one who can't resist asking "PS, I have another friend who is a zombie."  He's now the greatest immortal being ever!  And HE's not dead yet: he's just HODICARE BANFIBER.  Are we to accept that, really?  Newborn babies are no longer immortality by any means, and the only ethical position is to kill and eat people?

Utahraptor: Well, it's a long time, considering how everything has changed over time!
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yes, the debate over whether or not to kill and eat people has gotten us into some pretty hot waters.  Couldn't we all be saved from our greatest fears and solved with less suffering??
T-Rex: *gasp*
Utahraptor: *GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHT
Utahraptor: I don't know why you're trying to holodrive me, but it seems to have saved a lot of lives!!

T-Rex: Really?
Utahraptor: Yep!
T-Rex: But the cure is really in the pill form, right?
Utahraptor: Right!
T-Rex: I've been saving lives all along, but the chance of you dying just because you were inspired to is just as great!  How could I have been inspired?
