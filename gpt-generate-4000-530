T-Rex: I have been compiling a list that I think might be of value!
God: WHAT'S THE VALUE OF A COUPLE OF EARLY MORNINGS
T-Rex: ...good one, Dromiceiomimus!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Nice list! of values I've compiled that I think are pretty okay: about me!
Utahraptor: I can't believe I committed a crime!

T-Rex: I've got some very pretty values!
Utahraptor: But, like, what if you're an aesthetic? What if you're just a value for money?
T-Rex: aestheticism!
Utahraptor: That's technically true!

T-Rex: But what if I said I was gonna write a book where I illustrated everything?
T-Rex: That's what I'm doing!
