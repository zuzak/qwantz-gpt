T-Rex: I don't like missing out on awesome things, but I'm worried that awesome things are happening ALL THE TIME AROUND ME AHHHHHH

Narrator: T-Rex has a new friend who are getting MARRIED.

T-Rex: We went out on a date and she got cold feet, so we got into a fight and I lost. But we survived and we love her and now we're going to eat all her foodcakes. I love you and I'm glad we had this relationship.

Utahraptor: I don't think we lost!
T-Rex: Oh man, I totally did!

T-Rex: I love you and I'm glad we had this relationship.
Utahraptor: My friend, you're not allowed to SUMMARIZE this relationship without breaking up!
T-Rex: Utahraptor! We're going to have an "AWESOME THING", my friend.
Utahraptor: Yes sir, I am.
T-Rex: Love and sex and little secret love.

Narrator: BUT, SECONDS BEFORE EVERYONE WANTS TO PARTY:
T-Rex: Well, I think this has been handled delicately. I'm glad we had this relationship.
T-Rex: Thanks!
