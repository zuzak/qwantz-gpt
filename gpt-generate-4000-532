T-Rex: I've entered a poetry contest!

T-Rex: I enter because I'm really excited about poetry!

T-Rex: I really love poetry, Dromiceiomimus!  I love the idea of a world-weariness contest that relies upon passing as well as the ability to capture and understand feeling in words.
Dromiceiomimus: I don't know, T-Rex!  Maybe I'll just take a picture of myself with the words printed on it, and use that as my inspiration.
T-Rex: Whoah!  I really think you do like the taste of poetry!

Utahraptor: So what's your entry?
T-Rex: Just a picture of me with the words printed on my Glass O' Lantern, and then I draw a comic about it!

Utahraptor: And I draw a picture of myself holding the words on a neon sign that says "LOL, Not This Second A Victim of My Own Good."  A nice little image for the Reader's Digest.
T-Rex: I love that, Utahraptor.

Narrator: AFTERWARDS:
T-Rex: What a neat image!
T-Rex: The words are "Ruby Rose: The Best Flower Ever Tasted; Also, She Wasn't Sad Anymore".
T-Rex: Definitely check it out if you're interested in justice, Dromiceiomimus!
