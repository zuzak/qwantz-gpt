T-Rex: Time for a funny joke, Dromiceiomimus!  Alright?
Dromiceiomimus: Okay!
T-Rex: Okay, fine, but not one that's very funny.  We've all made some bad decisions or gotten through a lot of email.
Dromiceiomimus: Like when you didn't get your email or did you get a weird email stuck?

T-Rex: Man, that's just because I didn't get my email or did I get through to someone else?  Pfft.  A half a joke.  Alright.  Alright.
T-Rex: Alright.  Alright.

Utahraptor: So you laugh when you get a lot of emails?
T-Rex: Sometimes!

T-Rex: I got a couple of really cool emails, one of which said if I told you about the wedding...
Utahraptor: ...I would laugh at you.  As a man who is "always on" and "always ready to share", I can tell you...
T-Rex: That's not a real joke.
Utahraptor: That's a joke from last night!  And it's from a joke you were really chuckling.

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!  What a hilarious joke it was!
T-Rex: (You're not allowed to laugh at jokes)
