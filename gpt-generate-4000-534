T-Rex: My new song is about a guy who puts food on the table. And, of course, a VERELY OBVIOUS, MUSIC.

T-Rex: It's about a food on the table!

T-Rex: And it's profoundly upsetting, because this guy has no name for food. No, he puts red meat and cheese on the plate, and then, after they're combined, he puts eggs and milk on the plate.
Dromiceiomimus: Sounds pretty good!
T-Rex: I know, right? There's got to be names for things like that.

Utahraptor: I think you're on the fence,my friend!
T-Rex: How?

Utahraptor: My friend, I think you're a little kid, trying to decide what food is appropriate for a room with a name on it.
T-Rex: Oh, that's wrong! On its face, anyway.
Utahraptor: It's true.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE CHILLING "FACTS" OF LONDON!
T-Rex: My name is T-Rex, and I have a dish that isazoid, and I put red peppers on top. Top says "Polonius", and inside the words "Genus Assamot".
T-Rex: There's corn on the plate, and the words "Genus" are stuffed into the corn.
