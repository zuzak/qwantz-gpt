T-Rex: I have come up with a perfect way not to believe in anything wrong ever again. IT'S A PERFECT WAY not to believe in everything wrong!!

T-Rex: So! Wait - THAT'S entirely rational!

T-Rex: But I've gone over my expectations too! I've dropped the ball! I'm going to do it like this:

T-Rex: FIRST, I'm going to say I think things will be great for a lot of time.
Dromiceiomimus: Things will be great for a lot of years?
T-Rex: Fine, whatever!

Utahraptor: I'm not sure years are a best friend, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Sure!!

Utahraptor: Well, I guess you're not a temporal person if you have temporal friends, right?
T-Rex: WE'LL DEFINITELY DISAGREE IF IT'S THE RIGHT thing for you, but it's not my temporal friend! I'm just here to tell you that it will be great for a while.
