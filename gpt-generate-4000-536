T-Rex: What if - what if a book I read wasn't actually a really good book?

T-Rex: LITERALLY writing my own WORD?

T-Rex: It's not sure what to tell, actually - a lot of people seem to have trouble separating WILDERNESS, obsession with WORDS, WILDERNESS, obsession with WINDOW. What if I just had a REAL dream, and it turned out to be a fake one?
Dromiceiomimus: And what if you had a REAL dream but it turned out to be a fake dream??
T-Rex: AND what if you had a REAL dream but it turned out to be a real dream with all the crazy epics?

Utahraptor: That's - that's the dream in a nutshell!
T-Rex: AND BOOM, everyone!

T-Rex: You! You've heard of dreamt-times T-Rex: you're the guy who wakes up in a real world and studies that up and then went to study that up, but then came home and said "I really wish I had gone to bed early earlier", but now he's dreaming about that! He wants to make that dream come true.
Utahraptor: A friend of mine has a case of the dream of bald men, but he's willing to go through all the hoops if it means I get to meet him at the cinema.

T-Rex: THE END
T-Rex: PS: If my dream is to become a powerful Mime, this is it.
T-Rex: PS: If my dream is to become really great at video games, this is it.
T-Rex: PS: If my dream is to become an INTRODUCTION GUY, this is it.
