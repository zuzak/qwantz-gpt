T-Rex: I just realized that no women have ever been to the moon! ONLY DUDES. DUDES WHO RETURNED AS MEN.

T-Rex: Apparently, you need a sausage to get on the moon!

T-Rex: Wait, that's not actually true!  On the moon, dudes stick their arms in the air and try to BOIL the earth's core.
Dromiceiomimus: That sounds like it might be a good idea to automate some of this, T-Rex!
T-Rex: How'd you figure?

Utahraptor: Man, you know exactly how that happened!
T-Rex: I got kinda sleepy the entire time I was sleeping!

Utahraptor: I imagine.  Like, one night, you could dream you were alone with your room, and then you'd be pulled around by all the pedestrians passing by to the south, and then you'd be pulling away from those two pedestrians as you passed by.
T-Rex: Sounds pretty awesome!
Utahraptor: I, too, were sleepy!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary! I-
T-Rex: I was in bed when I noticed all the NEARwES were leaving, leaving me alone in the darkness!!
