Narrator: SMALL METAPHORS
T-Rex: Perhaps okay!

T-Rex: If you have a big idea, say, graphic for a character in a story, you can use a medium to help your story tell!
Dromiceiomimus: Well, okay: a medium that is linear, like a phone call, with a flat, unadorned face?
T-Rex: Awww! Sweet!

Utahraptor: It's hard to figure out what medium is best when you're writing a story about a small idea!
T-Rex: Man, that's super hard!

T-Rex: I don't know, I just feel I've got the best medium for small-scale storytelling.
Utahraptor: Great. I'll be the first to say it. I'm the best medium for small-scale storytelling.
T-Rex: Me too! Okay, let's talk about it.

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: It's my pleasure, Utahraptor. I am the best medium for small-scale storytelling.
Utahraptor: Why? You're the best at it.
T-Rex: It was the best of times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
T-Rex: Fields, don't you think?
