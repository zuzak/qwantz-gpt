T-Rex: I just realized that no women have ever been to the moon! ONLY DUDES. DUDES WHO RETURNED AS MEN.

T-Rex: Apparently, you need a lifetime of accumulated shame and male terror to return, and that is too easy!

Dromiceiomimus: Wait -- yeah, I get it! I get that --

T-Rex: Well, I don't get that Dromiceiomimus is going around saying "no" to this REASONABLE woman. I don't get that she's going around saying "No." WITH THIS FRIGGIN ARGUMER I'm saying "No to the reaping and digesting, and no to the boner that follows!"
Dromiceiomimus: I've already said one thing that might be of use!

Narrator: THE END

Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Hey, Utahraptor!

T-Rex: Hey, listen, you're not cut out to be friends with me, T-Rex.
Utahraptor: Not really, dude. I'm just here to make sure you're not cut out to be friends.
T-Rex: Hah hah! Geez.
T-Rex: Anyway, I kinda hit you over the head with a frying pole today.

Narrator: THE END
Narrator: T-REX'S EXTREME SUCCESS:
T-Rex: What the hell was he talking about?
