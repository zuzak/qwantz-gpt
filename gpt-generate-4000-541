T-Rex: Yesterday I saw one of those zombie skulls! It was extremely terrifying!

T-Rex: And it was on display in my living room, because, hey, it was a skull that I had lying around!

T-Rex: And it had a HOLOGRAMM attached to it: I mean, if you didn't know about zombie skulls.
Dromiceiomimus: I had one of those too!
T-Rex: Exactly! But it turned out that the brain wasn't telling the whole story, so she turned to the brain itself for closure. It turns out that the brain didn't survivalously respond to visuo-spasive touch, so it was paralyzed, and now found itself constantly frozen in time.

Utahraptor: I think that's a time machine?
T-Rex: OH MY GOD, THAT'S SO FALSE

T-Rex: Anyway, I had a really good idea! If you gave zombies brains that never die, you could potentially give them disposable gloves that can be attached to anything. And I actually think that's a good idea!
Utahraptor: Okay, but if you give brains brains that can freeze, and then flesh can be replaced with fake ones!

T-Rex: SERIOUSLY?
T-Rex: When you give brains brains, the bodies of others are more precious than your own!
T-Rex: *gasp*
