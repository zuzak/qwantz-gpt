T-Rex: English has like a million words in it! So we've got a word for everything, right?

T-Rex: WRONG NO THAT'S WRONG STOP SAYING THAT

T-Rex: For example, the Portuguese have the word "saudade" which means basically "deep nostalgic longing for something that's left and is loved and which, though we may repress that knowledge, may never return." You can even get the saudades for someone in the present while anticipating the future, or for something that doesn't even exist!

Utahraptor: It's kind of like a frothy mixture of nostalgia and regret, right?
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: So you can see why it appeals to me. We should lexicalize that sentiment into a single English word, so that we too might talk about it more easily and -- dare I dream -- more often?
Utahraptor: Okay! What'll the word be?
T-Rex: Let's go with...NOSTALGRETZ.

T-Rex: "I've got nostalgretz for the town I grew up in: we moved away after it was destroyed by aliens and that battle was covered up the the man; I'm on the run now because, like the truth, I refuse tho be silenced."
T-Rex: That sentence was a lie and none of us was on the run AGAIN.
