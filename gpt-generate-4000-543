Narrator: TIPS FOR JOB HUNTERS
T-Rex: Attention, people who are hunting you!  You are squabbling babes in need of a fudgie name!

T-Rex: NOW THEY'RE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT SEX.

T-Rex: Let them say hello, if they can get you to say hello, please do! Let them see this. Say "Welcome to my sleepy grave, Dromiceiomimus".
Dromiceiomimus: "My, my, my?"
T-Rex: "YS, MY, MY".
T-Rex: Let them see this. If you've got a question, just say "Uh, my question is'em for you"

T-Rex: Let them see THAT. Let them know that you'RE TALKING TO ME ABOUT SEX, and that you know someone who is having sex with them. Let them know that you know a lot about their day and they'll probably make sure to tell them about it. Let them know that you know about their opinions, and when you give food to a baby, you know about it. Let them know that no matter what, people are willing to listen to you.

Utahraptor: Let them know that you know a lot about their life, and they'll probably take care of it for you!
T-Rex: YES!

T-Rex: Let them know that no matter what, people are willing to listen to you.
Utahraptor: Let them know that no matter what, people are willing to listen to you
T-Rex: Let them know that no matter what, people are willing to listen to you

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hello, my name is T-Rex and I'm here to say / I just ate a whole lasagna for lunch!
Utahraptor: Is it a lasagna?
T-Rex: YEP! It's great, because it includes the option to put the egg on top of the meat. I like it!
