T-Rex: "Antonio Tony and Amelia wake up in a world where suddenly everyone has gone blind - EXCEPT THE PEOPLE IN THE WEDDING!!"

T-Rex: "They wake up in cells where every single one of their body's cells is now missing! And this is worse than before: every single one of their cells is dying each year!"

T-Rex: "In a place called Medusa's house, babies are sleeping there as well!"
Utahraptor: "We've all been there!"

T-Rex: "...We're seeing the same thing," Antonio added.
Utahraptor: "I think you're being kind of a dick, Antonio," said Amelia.

T-Rex: "You're not only imposing your own life style on another, more imposing universe, but at the end, you're also KINDAING IT to make it EXPERIENCED. How are you going to make it RATIONAL?"
Utahraptor: "Look, we're all alone," Antonio said.

T-Rex: "Look at us and report," Amelia said.
T-Rex: "And literally all of them, figuratively and literally," Antonio added.
