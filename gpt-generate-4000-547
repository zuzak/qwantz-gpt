T-Rex: Okay, so nobody knows about your "12 Angry MEN" joke, but congrats! You're no longer offended!

T-Rex: Congratulations!

T-Rex: Now you know why people say "It's an angry man! That's not an allegory!"
Dromiceiomimus: Okay, but dudes, many of my friends are of Indian origin.
T-Rex: I don't - I don't know. I'm just a little surprised by what I ended up doing?

Narrator: 10 MINUTES LATER:
T-Rex: EXCUSE ME LIBRARIAN BUT AM I A... MINOR?
No, sir: that's racist!

T-Rex: I hate to be the one to say that, but I didn't want to be the one to say that, and I'm sorry!
Utahraptor: Man, I feel bad about that! I've been through it too - it'll probably be against my will!

Utahraptor: Oh, the sort of thing you say in SECRET ROLE! You don't say it in your public life.
T-Rex: Sorry, in private!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: SECRETLY I have feelings!
