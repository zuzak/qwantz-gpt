T-Rex: In the 1600s scientists from history were discovering a lot of things about science! It was an exciting time to be a scientist from history!

T-Rex: But they were also concerned about people stealing their ideas!

T-Rex: So while still working out the particulars, they'd publish the basics of their ideas IN SECRET CODE. Robert Hooke's published his law of elasticity as "ceiiinosssttuv". And Newton wrote a letter to his chum Leibniz where he was all "6accdae13eff7i2l9ntr8o". It was all a bit like... leeching me from history??

Utahraptor: And unbeknownst to him, Leibniz was working on inventing science!
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: So when Leibniz announced she was writing a law of elasticity that explained how our breath works, Newton wrote back to Leibniz in a letter and said he'd love to know how her law worked.
Utahraptor: She kinda ignored him and in a letter to his chum Leibniz said she'd invented calculus and the laws of physics were all her own.

T-Rex: What a great friend and an amazing writer!
Utahraptor: I know this and I'm really pleased with how things turned out!
T-Rex: Okay, I'll tell you what I'm told: you're the first person I ever DEFINITELY call when I want to share my amazing story with someone!
