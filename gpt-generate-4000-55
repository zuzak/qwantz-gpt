T-Rex: With the right clothes, you can dress up fancy; you can look both super attractive AND ultimate sexy.

T-Rex: Look at me! I just got the super attractive one.

T-Rex: I simply defined attractive twins as anyone with a sexy theme.
Dromiceiomimus: I think you're becoming a subset of the ruleo um, a people who are super sexy and super wacky!
T-Rex: Whoa! Whoaaaaah! How do you mean, like, a people who are super wacky AND/OR eponymous?

Utahraptor: Well, I don't see what you're doing here, T-Rex!
T-Rex: What?

Utahraptor: What I'm doing is called "unattractive twins", shorthand for everyone who's not just a bunch of wacky kids, or "theatres", as they're called in olden times. The phrase has now been reduced to "attractive clothes that people with regular clothes can wear" or, more colloquially, "the idea that attractive women are attractive".

T-Rex: I can't get past my clothing fetish!
Utahraptor: What?
T-Rex: You can't get past your clothing fetish!
