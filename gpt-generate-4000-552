T-Rex: Hey God, would the world be an even awesomer place if everyone named "Benjamin" and "Walter" were named AFTER famous figures from history?
God: YES
T-Rex: I was going to say "Benjamin" and "Walter" and then underline my christmas present by naming "Albert Einstein Bau-lee-n" after Hitler!

God: NO T-REX THIS IS NOT REAL LIFE
T-Rex: Awww!

Utahraptor: You didn't put "Benjamin" after Hitler!  You only put "Albert Einstein Bau-lee-n" after HISTORIOUS figures from the Nazi Party!
T-Rex: Wow!  Well, I guess I'M glad I didn't put "Herrn" after her in 2000 because I never forgot!

Utahraptor: "Just sayin'', man"s awesome too!  "That's the party!".
T-Rex: OMG, who just got elected Utahraptor?  MyEMBER HORIZONTAL NEST!
Utahraptor: Hah!  You should be ashamed of your racist name!
T-Rex: My pleasure!  I WAS NABBLING MY OWN BABY FOR YOUR consideration!!
