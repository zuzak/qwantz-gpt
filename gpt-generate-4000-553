T-Rex: Hello! Do you want to find someone to commit to and share THE ENTIRE REST OF YOUR LIFE WITH? Because you don't have a t-rex's pillow!

Narrator: HOW TO BLUFF YOUR WAY THROUGH EVERY CONVERSATION ABOUT FEELINGS

T-Rex: Okay! Have fun, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: yea
T-Rex: EXCELLENT.

T-Rex: You know what? Maybe I will!
Utahraptor: Whoah, what?

T-Rex: What? Dude, I just had total dominion over the minds of people who didn't even need to be there part of the day!
Utahraptor: Okay, well, maybe they can still do things they're doing on the job.
T-Rex: I know! Maybe they can beINGS awesome.

Narrator: Later:
T-Rex: God, give me that speed!
God: T-REX HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT'S REALLY NICE?
T-Rex: Well, there's all these really great pictures of me and my little dudes.
God: I DON'T KNOW WHO I WISH TO BE WHEN I HAD TO DO THIS
