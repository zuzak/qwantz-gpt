T-Rex: If I ever build an office building, I'll have the world's most colossal outbuilding!

T-Rex: That's because outbuildings are terraunctangular, and shaped like domus leaves!

T-Rex: In terms of function, spangled allusiones is my least-favorite part of the city!
Dromiceiomimus: What's it like working in an outbuilding, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Man, I don't know. I've got a lot of feeling in my house!

Utahraptor: You're always on about the inbuilt clich?
T-Rex: It's WRONG. Agreed.

Utahraptor: So you think the inbuilt clich is misleading: all you need are deep thought, and the only job you need to giving people hope is the easy way out.
T-Rex: Exactly! Little secrets, like exploit-alls and cusses.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hey God, has it been four days in the making?
God: WE HAD THAT MAN ON OUR DOOR SO DO I KNOW
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: ...Hold on. That. Allude to the fact that our next project may be a chickypants get-up?
