T-Rex: I have come up with a way to get my house out of the way! A way to be the last to die!

Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS
Narrator: today's technique: "DEATH-DOUBLE RAP"

T-Rex: It works because if I die in the last moments, thousands of years after my creation, a narrative will follow, with everything I die in, the end. It is, after all, a very real and realistic past.
T-Rex: What's more, if I am not seen as a figure in the imagination then there won't be a theme or motifs in my story. Instead, what is left is a stark, silent, tragic picture.

Utahraptor: How do you figure this?
T-Rex: I don't know, what I'm going to say.

Utahraptor: The way you operate is really that smart; the more you know, the more you expect nothing less than death.
T-Rex: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Utahraptor: Whoah, hold up!
Utahraptor: I don't know, what I'm going to say.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND:
T-Rex: I don't see what the big deal about immortality is! Why haven't we made a life-altering, home-made device, called "suicide" for something like twenty years!
T-Rex: I PRESENT IT TO my friend, Dromiceiomimus!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, you're a real man! You have nothing to boast about!

Dromiceiomimus: I see!
T-Rex: Utahraptor, you can't talk like you're bragging about!
Utahraptor: Yeah, I see.

Utahraptor: ...Alright, I'll take the easy way out!
T-Rex: FINE

Utahraptor: I'm going to walk you to your destination, T-Rex!  Walk me to your own home, hug you cordially!  Let me see you there!
T-Rex: GOODBYE, THAT IS!
