T-Rex: Like walking, but wish you could end up way sweatier and gross at the end?
T-Rex: Consider jogging, friends!

Narrator: TIPS FOR JOGGERS

T-Rex: It's so great, Dromiceiomimus! It's great when you can do both at the same time and you can TOTALLY DIE. It can also be useful when trying to lose weight, or when trying to lose weight you and your friends are GREAT AT FIGHTING HARDER than you are at eating ALL DAY.
Dromiceiomimus: That's very true, T-Rex!
T-Rex: super! I'M VIRGINITIVELY SURE YOU COULD TEAM UP AND I'M VIRGINITIVELY SAVING YOURSELVES AT THE END.

Utahraptor: Another great tip is to practice "um if", only two times, only for two years!
T-Rex: Indeed!

Utahraptor: And you train hard and do it often. That's impressive!
T-Rex: Yep! And it's great if you have the #1 PAL T-Rex fetish and you have the habit of only having the clothes you want to wear for a few years, called "cookie pylons" - they're really the only coloured ones - and then don't wear them again.
Utahraptor: That's just like the TV show!

T-Rex: Yep! I know! I only wish I had that fetish!
T-Rex: It makes me feel good!
