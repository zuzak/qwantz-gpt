T-Rex: Instead of being disappointed by how sucky and dated you are, if someone were dating me, I'd be so happy! Assuming they were single-use bras that were OFICE, it stands to reason that they would be SO INTO my sexy dance that they would EVEN TASTE IT OFF. I'm - I'm not sure I can do that?

Utahraptor: You're saying they'd be SO OFF about it?
T-Rex: Yeah, I'm SURE that's what she thought!

T-Rex: But she wasays me and the results of that research have shown her to be a pretty good friend!
Utahraptor: Oh, so I wasish your sort of thing.
T-Rex: No no, I was just hoping for your sort of thing too! I had a similar story, but different ideas of what a good friend should be.

Narrator: SUDDEN DEPRESSING ENDING COMICS!
T-Rex: So - after my story was published I received death threats.
T-Rex: But I still love you!
