T-Rex: In fascism, one person is in control of an entire country, and he tells everyone else what to do! He is the guy who is micromanaging the actions of his agents.

T-Rex: He also has the misfortune to hold the reins of government together, and do so easily.

T-Rex: So he runs around with his mouth open, trying to find a slogan for his new job. All he finds is a woman he've never married, and with them they've got a daughter!
Dromiceiomimus: And what happens?
T-Rex: Fascism was the idea, really. Basically, it's this idea, all the leaders of the statists to overthrow the God we know and love, that a woman should be a leader in everything. Just like Hitler!

Utahraptor: Fascism actually didn't work on Hitler!
T-Rex: What?

Utahraptor: Well, let's just accept that it's the smart thing to do! Fascism is based on hope and dreams: if you let them happen, they can be dreams! And dreams can lead to power and chaos!
T-Rex: Horrifying.
Utahraptor: That's what I'm in for!

T-Rex: Anyway, what's the name of that year in the year?
Utahraptor: "????"
T-Rex: "??.??"
Utahraptor: No way! It's the name of my current government, which I'm really excited about!
T-Rex: HOW DID YOU KNOW
