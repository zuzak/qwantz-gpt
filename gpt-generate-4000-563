T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! Oh MAN.  I'll never work that out.

T-Rex: All I've got to do is make a living!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, do you have any idea how big you are?
Dromiceiomimus: I'm just beyond it! I'm a big dinosaur with a frankly frightening reputation!
T-Rex: But! I didn't mean to say anything!  I'm not even sure what you're talking about. Utahraptor!

Utahraptor: No, I meant, like, if I were big into meat or if I was a big vegetarian, yeah.  I'd eat it.
T-Rex: Then.  Then I was big into meat.

Narrator: ONE WEEK LATER:
T-Rex: I've got to help the rabbits out of their new house!
Utahraptor: What are they doing here?
T-Rex: Eating their new house in the new language?
Utahraptor: I'm sorry, T-Rex, but you don't understand.
Utahraptor: I WAS asking you.
T-Rex: How is it that you're so quick to make such a big deal out of something so small?

Narrator: A FEW WEEKS LATER. . .
T-Rex: I'm so glad I invented it!
