T-Rex: There's a lot of dumbass names for things, right? And for such a thing as and . . . weirdness?

T-Rex: I will respond with the name of the person doing the weirdness!

T-Rex: It's a smart name since it suggests a lot of things, and it works with weird things I've seen and done! It will perhaps change my life and reputation as a weirdo.
Dromiceiomimus: It sounds a little like a lot!
T-Rex: The name "H.A.T.L.T." works with my current slang!

Utahraptor: Hey, what's your name?
T-Rex: Utahraptor.

T-Rex: I am a member of the Dromiceiomimus's Court!
Utahraptor: Yes, that's pretty weird.
T-Rex: Yes, well, that's actually super weird.
Utahraptor: Listen, I'm sorry I called you up but I'm off to go have a bath. I'll miss you in a little while, but for the past, we've been having a symposium.

T-Rex: The symposium is going well, Utahraptor! I'm glad you're here. I'm glad you've decided to become my guest!
Utahraptor: I'm not going to stay because I have a good point! I'm going to learn about the world and how we experience it!
T-Rex: Good news, Utahraptor! The symposium is only going to get better, and I hope you'll come! I hope you'll come by foot!
