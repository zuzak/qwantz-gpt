T-Rex: Depending on when in their lives this happens, the "OH MY GOD" that escapes your lips could be one of the deepest sympathy OR terrific excitement!

Narrator: SO YOUR FRIENDS ARE GETTING PREGNANT
Narrator: a web card

T-Rex: Well, here's the new normal: your friends are going to talk about babies for the next several years.  Are you interested in babies?  If yes, terrific!  If no, however, you'd better start learning how to pretend.  Here's how to pretend:
Dromiceiomimus: How are you going to get your friends to talk about babies?
T-Rex: I'm sorry, I just can't figure out this problem!  I have a solution.

Utahraptor: "Oh my god, absolutely no, how can I be entertained without having babies?"
T-Rex: No, you're right.  I've turned the computer on and off to entertain myself AND my advertised "babies" are going to be INSANE.

Utahraptor: How are you going to figure this out?  You have advertised babies, dude!  This is like a disposable habit toothbrush.  Just rinse and repeat after me:
T-Rex: Oh my god, absolutely no.  This is your second time having ANY association with the term "babies"!
Utahraptor: Second time?  You forgot to remove your second time and second worse experience?
T-Rex: Apologize?  No?
Utahraptor: Oh my gosh it's terrible!

T-Rex: I've commoditized life and society in a way that my parents couldn't!  I was never going to!
T-Rex: I have no regrets!
