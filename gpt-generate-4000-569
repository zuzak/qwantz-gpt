T-Rex: Today I will become...

T-Rex: a comic artist!

T-Rex: Because in the beginning, I will have a single dream: to create.  To make one's self a single dream.
Dromiceiomimus: That's a bit of a challenge, T-Rex.  What if instead of a dream, one could enter the world and become...

T-Rex: a painter?
Utahraptor: Yep!  Or a sculptor?

T-Rex: Or a storyteller?
Utahraptor: Or both?
Utahraptor: What if one's dreams were something reality could truly be, but one failed to see amidst all the illusions and fantasies?

T-Rex: Oh my goodness if I had a dream I'd enjoy being a sculptor, painting, or writer, I don't know!  I would break out the "cute and sensible" fantasy!  OH DEE OUT, BECAUSE WHO'S GETTING ARTICulated ABOUT MY DREAMS??
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: It's so sad!  My life is turned upside down so I can't even talk about my DREAMS, let alone write erotic fiction!

T-Rex: ...No, wait, that's terrible, too!  I could write a really erotic story!
T-Rex: Hah!  PRETTY IMAGES!
