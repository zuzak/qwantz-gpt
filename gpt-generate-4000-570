T-Rex: I have come up with a totally original way to prevent my superintelligent email AI from trying to take over the world! And it's way more reliable than just programming in restrictions against that.

T-Rex: Tic Tac Toe!

T-Rex: I'll simply make my AI play billions and billions of games of Tic Tac Toe, and in doing so it will realize the fundamental futility of war!
Dromiceiomimus: One might assume that, since peace in any situation is impossible, one can just as easily play this game think about how much of every life being reduced to dourism and then suddenly, one can play!

Utahraptor: Yeah, this is sort of a "massive war" answer to get players, my friend, over by the end.
T-Rex: Yes, please. YES.

T-Rex: Well, that's not actually true. My AI will then play those games and come up with a way around it, and that's exactly what I've come up with!
Utahraptor: But there'll be war! Just by running into one, it will be impossible to fire your game!
T-Rex: Exactly! No war, no matter how many civilizations it is played in.

T-Rex: Anyway, this is what I came up with. Um, it only costs a few billion dollars, and all the other consequences are in the balance - already, already paying off my education and health insurance?
Utahraptor: It is, in fact, a pretty good solution.
T-Rex: YEP, OKAY. I'm - I'm actually totally pals with none of them but I have no plans to of COURSE of all these things.
