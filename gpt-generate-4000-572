T-Rex: In my new video game, you control a lady named "Mary Oh". She's of Chinese descent, which explains her awesome name!

T-Rex: But her name is different - and more awesome! - from the more commonly-used "T-Rex".

T-Rex: And YES, she's a fully-functional man - but she's a fully-functional man named "T-Rex". She investigates the house and finds a body: one exudes "empathy". And she controls the body well, by carefully controlling her nervous system.

Utahraptor: Are you 100% sure that every video game is the same, and every writer's dream?
T-Rex: I don't know, it's a big question!

T-Rex: How do you know a new genre has a particular cult following, and not just because a video game costs your game company the same as a non-game?
Utahraptor: Well - that's true.
Utahraptor: And that's why people are so vehement in their criticism.

T-Rex: Utahraptor, I say "claim" so you can't type, but I can type!
Utahraptor: I say "claim" so you can't type!
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I say "claim" so you can type!
Utahraptor: I say "claim" so you can type!
