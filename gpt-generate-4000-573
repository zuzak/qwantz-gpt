T-Rex: Some people have their first dream come true: to travel back in time and visit babies.

T-Rex: IRA: PARTY DATE

T-Rex: But I don't know if or how or if I will get EVEN SOMEHOW to do that.  I have to feel like an adult now, and I have to do it by me being that OTHER person's DREAM.  I have to put all my eggs into one giant duct and do it all by myself.
Dromiceiomimus: I guess, if that's how it's going to be done.
T-Rex: Not necessarily!  My friends are going to be DOGS.

Utahraptor: It's going to be dogs, T-Rex!  I'm serious.
T-Rex: It's going to be dogs.

Utahraptor: Dogs that I remember living with when I was a kid.  SOMETIMES.  SOMETIMES.
T-Rex: I imagine that had I been raised by an alcoholic father and raised by an illegal alien mother, I would have felt different things would HAPPEN.  I think there's nothing left in the world that I can't handle, and yet, I feel strong.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, come quick! I think I just trashed your house!
Dromiceiomimus: What?  I didn't!!
T-Rex: Ha ha, no, I didn't.  I'm just - I'm sorry, I don't have the time.
T-Rex: Scotty!
T-Rex: I'm sorry!
