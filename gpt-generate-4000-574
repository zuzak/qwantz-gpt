Narrator: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ETHICS AND MORALS
Narrator: hey adults! put me in your wallet!

T-Rex: Ethics and morals are not the same thing!

T-Rex: I know! It's CRAZY. But ethics are something that you learn and study and are applied in society, while morals are more natural and instinctive. That's why you can have a low moral fibre (they're more innate), but there's no ethical fibre. You can only have poor ethical training!
Dromiceiomimus: Amazing!
T-Rex: I know!

Utahraptor: So wait - can an act then be considered immoral, but still ethical?
T-Rex: Possibly?

Utahraptor: Well if you're moral isomorphic then you can't really be a moral guy, unless you have transitive moral training. I think in that you're really just doing training, like in religion, where you're training something to do a thing.
T-Rex: I know! I know!

Narrator: SORRY THIS COMIC HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND NOT A PROBLE
T-Rex: Really? Wow, I had a really hard time believing it!
T-Rex: And I was really glad to hear that!
