T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!

T-Rex: I will consider it as a "thon"!

T-Rex: And I will consider it as a "frig man"!

T-Rex: And I will consider it as a "runner" and I will consider it as a "ninja".
Dromiceiomimus: Do the Ninjas do the Ninja things?
T-Rex: Hells yes! What are you talking about? The Ninja's got a LIMBSPON!

Utahraptor: Well if it's good, then I think you'd want to do it!
T-Rex: Hells yes!

T-Rex: And then I think you'll want to do it, because, for me, it appears to be a rule that says "no man", so it is said in two different ways.
Utahraptor: And it rules?
T-Rex: It rules, friggin'!!

T-Rex: In the first place you are required to run in the last few metres, and in the second place you get a new man and try to run in the last few metres, only the friggin' numbers don't follow.
T-Rex: Oh! And you're required to wear the number three knot, which is pretty manly!
