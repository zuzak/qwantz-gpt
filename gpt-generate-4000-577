T-Rex: Guess who had their first dream of flying last night?

T-Rex: Gentlemen, ladies: calm down please!  It was me!!

Dromiceiomimus: You'd never dreamed about flying before?
T-Rex: I HAD, but they were always dreams in which everyone else could fly and I couldn't.  You know the one where everyone realizes they can fly by jumping and flapping their arms, but when you try it they just pull away and say "oh no oh no" and fly like crazy again?  And then everyone flies back to their original position!  I don't know why.

Utahraptor: I bet you were flying small to avoid traffic lights.
T-Rex: I WAS VESSELED BY AN ALIVE GIRL.

Utahraptor: Like, right now, anyway.  Small airports!  Small IF cars waiting to get on them at super-heavy-duty commuter sites!
T-Rex: There's no way you could fly small and not get turned around!
Utahraptor: So don't even fly MAX.

T-Rex: That's what I said!  I flew INSANE.  I landed in my own time, but now I... I...I GONE TOO MUCH FOR MY WITHK.
Utahraptor: It was a pretty great dream, T-Rex!  I may have landed in the primordial state of the emobres, but it's history is still young.
T-Rex: ALSO I DIDN'T PUT UP A PLANET.  The caps lock, dude!!

T-Rex: Aww, how awful are those dreams?
T-Rex: That one is pretty much universally welcomed
