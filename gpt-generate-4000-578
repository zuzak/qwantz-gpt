T-Rex: Two months ago I made the incredible discovery that pretty much everyone I ever know has an enemy: my friends!

T-Rex: And they're all super great, Dromiceiomimus! They're all like, super down to earth guys. Just kidding!

T-Rex: But their enemies don't like my story, Dromiceiomimus. They don't like my characters either! They like the Nazi SS officer that she meets on her way to work, who hilariously can't remember which bus he's been on, and whose birthday she's having a devil-themed dinner with.
Dromiceiomimus: I know! And I'll tell them my sexy story!
T-Rex: Okay YEAH I wouldn't be able to, but I WARNED MY FRIENDS! They would be INSANELY CERTAIN to know my story!!

Utahraptor: My story is called "A TALK WITH ROBERT SCOTT"
T-Rex: Your story is called "TALKING ABOUT EATING CHICKEN PARTS"

T-Rex: Listen, my story is really fun! We talk about eating chickens, and then we talk about how SCREW EATEN PARTS. Oh my goodness. We can do this.
Utahraptor: My chicken is so big!
T-Rex: My soul is great now!

Narrator: Next: Eating plants in galleries?
T-Rex: Yaaaay galleries. You know... galleries where chickens are happy.
