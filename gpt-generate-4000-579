T-Rex: Any machine that travels through time has to be a machine that travels through space as well! I've been saying this for years.

T-Rex: This is a problem the ENTIRE UNIVERSE ENDS WITH.

T-Rex: Even if I were a machine that travels through Time, it would take at most a thousand thousand years for me to reach this point!
T-Rex: Ridiculous. I'm going around saying things faster than anyone could even read!
T-Rex: That's not a problem.

Utahraptor: You're saying things that are even longer than that?
T-Rex: Obviously!

Utahraptor: And you're saying things that take time to travel through space, T-Rex! What are you saying now?
T-Rex: I said, the universe is going to cool a little and I have a good idea of what's going on.
Utahraptor: Oh. Good. I'm going to say something even more ridiculous to make you look good, but it's still dumb.

Narrator: THE END
Narrator: SO EVERYONE YOUR age who wants to come up with a way to travel through time but also has to pay for the privilege of standing during a movie sunrise:
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!
T-Rex: Nevermind!
