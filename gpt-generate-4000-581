T-Rex: I have the greatest idea for a book. A plan B, I gotta say!

T-Rex: A VAST MERCILESS HALLOWE'EN HALLOWE'EN!

Dromiceiomimus: Wait - that's actually a terrible idea, T-Rex! What it does is it's like, the crazy idea you've got for a book but nobody's seen it for years, and you've only been making it MORE ARTIFICIAL ever since you started making it public.
T-Rex: Um, finally? Then I'm done with building a person from video games. I'm done with building a person from art.
Dromiceiomimus: Perfect!
T-Rex: TRY FOREX A REVIEW OF LIFE AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY'RE LIKE

T-Rex: Okay, never played? Hold on, okay?
Utahraptor: Never played?

T-Rex: OKAY! I've got this idea in my head: all I need to do is figure out a way to get my hands on a computer and program a game based on his beautiful face.
Utahraptor: Easy! In fact, no, it's not hard. Just say "Hi" and if he asks you to play Mario, move them to the Mario In The House, okay?

T-Rex: Nope! My game is a platforming game where you're Mario, and the first thing you do is jump above and behind other characters to hit them.  And it's so fun!  Man!  Do you ever wonder if Mario's "handsome" and "empty" to the naked eye?  Because if not, turn to panel 3!
T-Rex: Because it's way funnier if they watch me play
