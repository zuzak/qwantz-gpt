T-Rex:  I think that there's no animal more symbolic than birds.  They're so SAD!

Narrator:  So sad!  Try as you may be, birds are not more than symbolic trees with hearts filled with love and kisses and kisses you sure will come back to in the future!

Utahraptor:  Sad trees?
T-Rex:  Really?  Really?

Utahraptor:  Yeah, the very sight of sad trees (especially one with two blossoms) may have been symbolic for us, as symbolic trees with two hearts that may never again be filled with love.
T-Rex:  It's true!  My heart is with you in filling out the details of this decision, T-Rex!

Narrator:  A few years later, the heart with two hearts could have been anyone!
T-Rex:  Two hearts?  WHO KNOWS?
Narrator:  But, luckily, one of them just happened to BRING TO LIFE TO COMPETE WITH YOUR COUPLE'S CASUAL INSERTION OF A SAD TREE??
