T-Rex: It's been what - four thousand years of civilization? That's a little exaggeration?

T-Rex: We're still talking about that!

T-Rex: But it's big enough to send us straight back in time. I believe we've ALREADY ICED the time of Our Own Free Choice.
Dromiceiomimus: That's the idea, T-Rex. Giant isn't it?
T-Rex: Sure! But to send BACK in time is just to say we had free will? Isn't that the same thing?

Utahraptor: I think you're confusing technology and people, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's a fine line, isn't it?

Utahraptor: I'm still big into talking technology into your projects, dude! I want to help you build a time machine, but I want you to invent it and use it to send messages back in time.
T-Rex: That's what I'm saying! I want DATA BACK IN TIME. Back to back voyages!

T-Rex: Back to send and receive!
T-Rex: (The messages are lost!)
