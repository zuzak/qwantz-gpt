T-Rex:  "My ultimate baby", by me, T-Rex.
T-Rex:  My ultimate baby is kinda a cyborg so it controls everything, and ALSO everything else.  It's a LITERAL "BIBLE THEATRE" except when it's destroyed.  That means it's a cyborg and only eats brains.  Only when it dies.  Only in space.  Only when it alters its GPRS.  Only when in shuttles.  Only when it circulates in the blood.  Only when it was given to children.  Only when it flew through a skyscreen.

T-Rex:  Only when weatherODger gets hit by a car chute and dies.  Only when a deranged arch-nemesis BROUGHT the giant to save humanity from a terrible genocidal flood.
Utahraptor:  And ONLY BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY GOD WANTS TO DESCRIBE THEM.

T-Rex:  Ahem.
T-Rex:  That's what I said about brains!!
