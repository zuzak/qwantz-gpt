T-Rex: Attention, scientists! Is there a SCIENTIFIC reason why poops are so gross?

T-Rex: Because poops are provably so gross!!

T-Rex: At first I thought maybe they're gross because they're waste, but not all waste is gross.  Rabbit poops are cute little pellets that don't really smell. But cow poops are giant puddles of sorrow! Sometimes they're crusty with sun-heated puddles of sorrow inside.
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex! Gross!!
T-Rex: I Know! Scientists need to look into this!!

Utahraptor: Maybe we think they're gross because they're bad to eat?
T-Rex: I do try to eat MOST things.

T-Rex: But if the body uses taste and smell to let us know instrinctually what's good to eat, is that 100%? Or are there poisons that taste SO GOOD that you go to your grave saying "Dudes. That taste: TOTALLY WORTH IT."?
Utahraptor: I have no idea.
T-Rex: Neither do I! I'm talking out of my ass here!

T-Rex: Oh my gosh I'm SO SORRY, I don't eat ANYTHING.  I mean, I eat POTTS.
Utahraptor: Really?  But not - POSSIBLY anything else?
T-Rex: Logically, there are things I could eat but not do, but certain foods could not taste OR smell the same!  I could drink Coca-Cola, but taste the delectable paltry taste of a stream of puddles.  I'm sorry, Oxford English Dictionary, but you're just fooling yourself.
