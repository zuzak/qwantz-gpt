T-Rex: Some people have trouble with their sexy-but-sexy bodies.

T-Rex: It's time to change our attitude!

T-Rex: How can we be positive when we can't see any of your sex acts?
T-Rex: Well, um, that doesn't make sense.
Dromiceiomimus: It's a tricky question, dude!
T-Rex: For one: who's to say who's not?

Utahraptor: The answer depends on what you think sexy is, and how well you know your bod.
T-Rex: Hah! "Totally sexual" is clearly a pretty big number!

T-Rex: But you can't say everyone has the same skills. Maybe they share the same fantasies, but few people know which parts of these fantasies get us pregnant.
Utahraptor: Or who, you know, has never experienced anything but good times?

Narrator: ANYWAY! T-REX SEES SOMEONE ELSE AND HE FAILS TO SHARE ANY REMAINING PROBLEMS:
T-Rex: Festering slumps!
