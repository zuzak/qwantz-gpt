T-Rex: What if I worked productively and creatively towards achieving my goals today?
Satan: WHAT IF YOU PLAYED VIDEO GAMES

T-Rex: OH MAN, WHAT IF I FREAK OUT, MY HANDSOME BODY WILL BLOW DOWN

T-Rex: And you're not allowed to heckle, right?  I AM NOT.  So I'm going to play video games and call them a bluff, just so they don't find out.  In the meantime, if you don't have a video game, you can smash those responsible responsible for "loading bad boy: GRAAH!!" into the same smelly chutes that are only used by horses.

Utahraptor: Let me guess: this guy didn't have a horse?
T-Rex: With - AND IN

Utahraptor: And let's say the guy you're chatting up is as lame as possible, and let's say he's a man who stacks floors with puns to make the floor come down.  Let's say he's the one who makes the puns stand on their own.  Let's say he's the one who makes the puns jump when the floor punches them.  Let's say he's the one who gets the floor to do that.  Let's say he's the one who gets the pun used when someone gets hit by a baseball bat.  I don't know.  Maybe he's the one who gets the pun used?  I don't know.  I've already convinced myself THAT you can POSSIBLY convince other people to play basketball with me.  I'll be that guy.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Wait, WAIT!  I forgot to mention I'm also the guy who made the puns jump when the floor punched a rock?
Utahraptor: That can't possibly be helped
T-Rex: I'M the one who makes the puns do it for me!
Utahraptor: I - I can't be the only guy who makes the puns jump in the gym!
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: I've done it! AND WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE GYM STATION TOO!
