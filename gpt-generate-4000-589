T-Rex: I am a guy who says "Five!" to solve problems.

T-Rex: And I do it all the time!

T-Rex: Say you want to solve the problem of zombies, but you can't find food or drink or breathe or be happy or think about hunger or something.  Five is the solution you arrive at.
Dromiceiomimus: Not bad, T-Rex!  But you're already using up five stars!
T-Rex: Not bad, but still not bad!  I thought we were agreed upon a compromise?

Utahraptor: But, you know, not necessarily!
T-Rex: Yes!

Utahraptor: So what do you say?
T-Rex: Five means "goodness", but this one is filled with questions!
Utahraptor: But maybe this is the right thing to say.  Is it like, "I love hunger?"
T-Rex: No, this is monstrous.  Hunger is a monstrous thing.  How do you fit me into my thoughts?

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Bad news, everyone!  My new "power" means ice cream, but it also means...
T-Rex: ...panties.
