T-Rex: Here's something that I, T-Rex the talking dinosaur, have trouble believing in: true love!

Narrator: T-REX AND FRIENDS DISCUSS: TR? L?V

T-Rex: The problem I have is that so many people claim to have found if, but the odds that you'd ever meet that one person AND that they'd be available, willing, and of the right gender and sexual orientation are really pretty small. CONCLUSION: a lot of people must be faking it!
Dromiceiomimus: But "true love" doesn't mean that there's only one person you can have it with!
T-Rex: Debatable! People often talk about finding "the one".

Utahraptor: I think that you're being too strict about this, T-Rex!
T-Rex: How's that?

Utahraptor: You're reading it as though everyone who has a card that says "I WANT TO MARRY YOU" and then goes on to say that you "can't imagine sex between cats".
T-Rex: How do you imagine sex?
Utahraptor: I don't know, man. Um... okay.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!
T-Rex: I know you're making fun of famous people, but it's clear you're only making fun of "the one". And I'm not a celebrity!
Shakespeare: that's not a real phrase
