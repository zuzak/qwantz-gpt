T-Rex: I am a guy who really likes Batman.  And it occurs to me: at some point in my life I'm going to be a Batman fan!

T-Rex: It's gonna be awesome!

T-Rex: It's gonna be so great that I never get to read the latest Batman news, and then come back when it's the latest Batman fan gossip!
Dromiceiomimus: Well, you'll have to long for that, T-Rex. Even if you do read the latest Batman news, you'll always find the Batman's every need filled.
T-Rex: I can't say that I want to change anything, Dromiceiomimus! But I can say that I DO want to read the latest Batman fan gossip!

Utahraptor: This is a terrible idea, T-Rex!  It doesn't work!
T-Rex: Utahraptor! It's terrible!!

T-Rex: It's gonna end in a grim, spooky, sepia-toned death.  When that's done, survivors of theerno will have spent their lives creating statues that rhyme with Batman's epitaph.
Utahraptor: This is just a regular death - meant to send the generation shambling towards 2025.
T-Rex: It sure would be great if that... came to pass!

Narrator: FRANCE, T-REX'S FAILED TO SUBTLE THE AREA:
T-Rex:...What the...?
Utahraptor:Awww! Thank you, T-Rex!
T-Rex: That's all I'm saying!
Utahraptor: So, tell me about the damn thing.
T-Rex: What?
Utahraptor:Awww!
T-Rex: What?!
Utahraptor:Awww!
Utahraptor:Can we talk about it like this?
T-Rex: This is no time for jokes!
