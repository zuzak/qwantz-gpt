T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!
Devil: I MIGHT?

T-Rex: Oh no, what have I done? I should have gone in front of you and said "hey, Dromiceiomimus, I want you to make a joke about how bad everyone in this room is a failure!"
Devil: I ASSURE YOU
Devil: I WISH I HAD THE TIME TO PLAY
Devil: WITH YOU

Devil: A LITTLE PHRASE
