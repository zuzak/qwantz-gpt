T-Rex: Hey, remember when email used to be fun and getting a new email was a joy?
T-Rex: SUCKERS.

T-Rex: I used to be more into email being cool now!!

T-Rex: But now I kinda left it at that! I used to use my email address (I 'M DONATING'), and then when I moved to a new place I used to send stuff to that address. Heck. I now use the address I just gave it, which I guess is still there even though I used to be dead.
Dromiceiomimus: So you don't think it's now?
T-Rex: I used to be cool, but now I kinda left it at that!!

Utahraptor: But you don't think you can get over a loss like that!
T-Rex: Man, I don't care! I'm trying to move away from this constant stream of negative messages!

T-Rex: "Sheep and goats: who WON'T stop by my house tonight? And I will be honest with you: I am a fiver! The message of my email is simple: I want my garbage to be well-eaten."
Utahraptor: "Well-eaten? Come on. Listen to me."
T-Rex: "DUNNO"
