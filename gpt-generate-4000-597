Narrator: DINOSAUR COMICS
T-Rex: Dinosaurs were giant ferocious lizards!

T-Rex: They were a constant threat to everyone around them!  They were known to destroy human property with impunity!

T-Rex: Dinosaurs were also known to destroy human LIFE with impunity!
Utahraptor: I notice you're using the past tense!

T-Rex: Yes.  It is correct.
Utahraptor: Well, it sounds more like "How are you, a dinosaur?"
T-Rex: "Well, I guess the analogies are pretty clear."
Utahraptor: Pretty sure that's where the reference is!

T-Rex: Yeah, that's where the reference is.
T-Rex: Pretty sure that's where the reference is.
{{title text: yes, they were big on using the word "dinosaur" to mean different things, yes they were big on such small animals being "animals", and yes, they were big on dudes lying down on the ground in that order.}}
