Narrator: DINOSAUR COMICS
T-Rex: Dinosaurs were giant ferocious lizards!

T-Rex: They were a constant threat to everyone around them!  They were known to destroy human property with impunity!

T-Rex: Dinosaurs were also known to destroy human LIFE with impunity!
Utahraptor: I notice you're using the past tense!

T-Rex: Yes.  I'm experimenting with it.
Utahraptor: You're experimenting with using negative imperative expansion.
T-Rex: YES.  I'M KINDA CHING CHING.
Utahraptor: I don't know why you're suddenly eschewing the negative imperative in favour of its complimentary constant.

Narrator: BUT THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT NOW!
T-Rex: I have data.
T-Rex: I'M IN THE PAST
