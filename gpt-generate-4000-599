T-Rex: Who here wants to watch me eat a sandwich?
God: SURE
God: NO

T-Rex: OKAY

God: I'M JUST GOING OUT TO SICKNESS
Utahraptor: Wear this shirt to a sandwich buffet tomorrow!

Narrator: YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MIND YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS COMIC:
Utahraptor: This shirt is way too awesome for me!
T-Rex: IT IS! It is not the sort of shirt that gives out when you're hungry.
Utahraptor: That's not me. I'm not gonna eat a sandwich!

Narrator: YOU'RE PLAYING SECRETS OF THE MEDIAN ORDER:
T-Rex: I'm gonna do it WHEN YOU SHOW UP
