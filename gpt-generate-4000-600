T-Rex: A pretty sweet lady wound up bruised and murdered.  But not for long!  In the meantime, I've got some bad news: her name was on the fridge that night!

T-Rex: And it turns out it was the wrong lady!

T-Rex: So: it turns out the killer was right here, in the fridge!  So, HELLO, do people have any memories of that night?  I can't think of any.
Dromiceiomimus: Probably - I know you liked the food, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Man, everyone loves good things that can be crushed, but if you've got a memory, maybe you'll want to remember this too!

Utahraptor: Ooh! Remember that house? The one you remember!
T-Rex: What? No! I remember it so well!

Utahraptor: Yeah, but nobody wants to see that!  Because like, next to the food, there's a note: "SOLVING MACHINE is harder than throwing it in a bog."
T-Rex: I remember perfecting mixing three kinds of liquid nitrogen!
Utahraptor: Impossible!

Utahraptor: I remember watching that video of it, and thinking, "gosh, what's my problem?  This is MY problem!"
T-Rex: Life's too short to have a problem like that, and I'm sorry, but we can't do anything about it!
