T-Rex: I have come up with a perfect way not to believe in anything ever again.  Evidentialism

T-Rex: A belief is justified only if there is sufficient evidence to support it!

T-Rex: Therefore, I won't believe in anything ever again!  except maybe the crappy food I eat, and maybe the crappy food I buy.
Dromiceiomimus: But you won't believe in THAT, T-Rex.  You won't believe in ANYTHING.
T-Rex: True!  However, I will not purchase a cup of delicious, yet-unsure juice from a stranger's kitchen.
Dromiceiomimus: A cup of delicious, yet-unsure juice?

Utahraptor: A cheaper, yet-deliciiiiiiiiight!
T-Rex: Aaaaaaaaaaan!

T-Rex: Now I'll swear by it sometimes.  Why would I do this?
Utahraptor: To prevent you from donating juice, please avoid this location.
T-Rex: Awww!
Utahraptor: That's it!  Of course!!
T-Rex: You know what?  I'll do the next best thing: I'll convert this house into a juice factory.

Narrator: BUT SOON, Utahraptor: A juice factory.  High fructose corn.
T-Rex: Science may have invented it, but I can't say I invented it.
T-Rex: :(
