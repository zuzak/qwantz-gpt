T-Rex: You know what I'm tired of feeling?
God: EMOTIONS
T-Rex: Pain!
T-Rex: (Emotions too.)

T-Rex: Anyway I've got some new emotions!

Narrator: A FEW COMMENTS POSTS THURSDAY:
T-Rex: booooooooooooooners
T-Rex: (I don't get it)

T-Rex: I've got one question: what does it mean to be happy?
Dromiceiomimus: Your happiness comes from a joy that makes you happy
T-Rex: Awwwwwww! That's crazy!
T-Rex: (I don't get it!)

Utahraptor: You don't get happiness from a few explosions or going out in public. You get it from a constant supply of pain!
T-Rex: (I don't get it!)

T-Rex: And my other question is this: how come everything sucks at night?
Utahraptor: You don't get happiness from a single hugestiod. You get it from constantly missing out on completely original artistic expression.
T-Rex: (You don't get it!)

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Oh hey, guys, I! My hilarious "whoah, whoah, whoah" monologue has been listened to over and over again!
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: This is why nobody likes jerks.
