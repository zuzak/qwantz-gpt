T-Rex: One day, T-Rex the handsome dinosaur was out for a walk.

T-Rex: Holy crap he was so handsome! And smart too, actually!!

T-Rex: He met his friend Dromiceiomimus who was also pretty nice. They were going to go on a trip...
Dromiceiomimus: Hi, T-Rex.
T-Rex: ... a trip to OUTER SPACE!
Dromiceiomimus: Oh, is that what's happening I gotta, um, go home.
Dromiceiomimus: I gotta... skate?

T-Rex: Then Utahraptor showed up and T-Rex said "hi"!
Utahraptor: Oh man. NO WAY.

Utahraptor: No way am I listening to you write fan fiction ABOUT YOURSELF, dude. This is like the ultimate level of onanism! You're supposed to do that stuff ALONE.
T-Rex: Suddenly Utahraptor decided to stop being mean!!
Utahraptor: Dude, the whole idea of autobio fanfic is awful!

T-Rex: Just then T-Rex changed his name to "Luke Starwars" and then everyone wanted to buy his book now that it's called "Luke Starwars, Vampire Guy! In This Story He Sees Some Sexy Bods"!
Utahraptor: Okay, that IS better, but still.
Utahraptor: That's like, a two-day loaner from the library, TOPS.
