Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hey GOD, MAYBE I'M AT BALDWIN'S FORCES AGAIN!?
God: I'M INTO THAT
T-Rex: What? It's like my dinner, but with meat!

God: HAH HAH THAT'S PRETTY SURE
T-Rex: What? Not a problem!

God: ANYWAY MAYBE I'VE MADE A BRIbery-wall ring-fence for you
Utahraptor: Whoah, T-Rex!

Utahraptor: Say whaaaat?
T-Rex: WHAT?
Utahraptor: Oh man I don't want to party!
T-Rex: Don't even get me toabba -
Utahraptor: Get me toabba back!!
Utahraptor: Get me toabba -

God: T-REX I'M GOD AND I SAY YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD ABOUT BAKING OFF A TABLE
T-Rex: This is my problem, God!
God: THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS
