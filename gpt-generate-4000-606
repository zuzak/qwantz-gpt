T-Rex:  Hello!  You know how some songs have lyrics that say "Suck on A Lie", or like the song, I wanna tell you right now I wanna SUCK ON MY SCORES.  Or like the song, here's how you feel:  suck it / On autopilot; suck it / Woo!

T-Rex:  On autopilot!

T-Rex:  That's how come I always feel!  And my theory is that the reason I always feel like masturbation is that I don't want to lose my virginity either!  I don't want to do it!  Why wouldn't I want to do it?  It's not like me to feel bad about it!
Dromiceiomimus:  I feel the same way!
T-Rex:  Maybe you do too!

Utahraptor:  On the other hand, you don't gossip.
T-Rex:  I don't gossip either!

T-Rex:  On the contrary, I freely admit that I am TEMPTED UP on the head by an entirely new sexual combination!
Utahraptor:  Whoah!  ...That's pretty awful.
T-Rex:  I don't gossip!  I tell you...

T-Rex:  ...ABOUT A FEW YEARS, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A BABY I WAS KINDA DIPPING BALLS OUT OF THEM LIKE POCKETS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
T-Rex:  ...Hold on.  That.
T-Rex:  Uh...
T-Rex:  THAT'S THE INTERNET.
