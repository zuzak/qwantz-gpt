T-Rex: What is exorcism for? Banishing demons back to hell, right?
T-Rex: RIGHT.

T-Rex: But... what if you're already IN hell?

T-Rex: HEAR ME OUT. I put to you that demons are clever, and would've LONG-AGO realized that they could possess and then exorcise EACH OTHER to productive ends. Hell is therefore full of demons saying "Can I possess you real quick so I can get someone out of here? I'm willing to".

Utahraptor: So productive ends don't exist?
T-Rex: Sure they do!

Utahraptor: So productive ends don't exist, T-Rex! Hell is a better place, and therefore better people, to possess and to use magic.
T-Rex: I say productive ends because it's better, actually! We've got Classified essays on the walls of hell that discuss the ins and outs of hell, and there's really not much to it than letting a dude write.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Pardon me?
Utahraptor: "I write stories about my friends."
T-Rex: That's what they say, right?
T-Rex: QUICK.  *That is the end of everything I've said thus far.
