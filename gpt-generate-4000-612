T-Rex: Attention, folks with low self-esteem!

T-Rex: Pretty sure you've got no-one to blame for that but yourself!!

T-Rex: And by that I mean, of course, only that it's really easy to feel good about yourself. For instance, I've recently picked up a hobby, and it's been super great! I signed up for an English as a Second Language course.
Dromiceiomimus: English is already your first language, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Guess what, Dromiceiomimus? Now it's my second language too!!

T-Rex: The courses are SO EASY, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: Yeah, I'd imagine!

T-Rex: Seriously, I'm top of the class! By like, a really large margin.
Utahraptor: But can't you see someone with low-self esteem feeling even worse, once they realize they've spent all this money on a class they don't need just to feel better than others who haven't had the same advantages?

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Is it terrible to say "It occurs to me that if I had different friends, I wouldn't be wrong all the time"?
T-Rex: Because it totally occurs to me that if I had different friends, I wouldn't be wrong all the time!!
