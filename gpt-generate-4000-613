T-Rex: I am a guy who just totally loves being a dude! It's cool to be both!

T-Rex: And the perfect companion?

T-Rex: The ultimate companion, my friends! The internet ultimate dude!
T-Rex: (What? I just chatted up the dude from my dating sim who I can't stop now, and they're still going on about how great I could possibly be someday)
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, you'd better not be making jokes about that. That's not "let's be awesome ALL the time" slang. That's "be awesome all the time".
T-Rex: Man! I've somehow forgotten the nuance of being awesome!

Utahraptor: So don't you think you're kind of a "dish"?
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: If only, if only because you allow no other emotion from your body to affect your life, let alone one moment of it!
Utahraptor: That's pretty great, T-Rex! I would think that you are a pretty great dude.
T-Rex: Heck, I'm not ashamed to be!

Narrator: LATER, T-REX COMES ACROSS A GIANT CRUISE SHERLOCK BUGS REPLACED WITH BEETS:
T-Rex: Excuse me, your friend, but nobody wants to kiss a giant bug with one hand and a handeeh-
T-Rex: I-
T-Rex: ...I -
T-Rex: HOPKIN'
