Narrator: COMICS WITH SUDDEN CHANGES IN GENDER
T-Rex: What a nice day to go out and do manly things.  Maybe stomp on a log?

T-Rex: Looks like it's time for some... MORE manly MANLY THINGS?

T-Rex: Not only can I do these, but yesterday's weather allowed me to climb indoors and help the other men out on the lawn, which I certainly did today!
Dromiceiomimus: Ah.  By "cllo" I mean "bigger]."
T-Rex: That's a good point!  I'm now actually really manly.  I may even have put "very manly" ahead of other manly professions.  "Clerking," as in "bigger is better"!

Utahraptor: So you're big into the idea of having that many manly "bigger" options?
T-Rex: Indeed!

Utahraptor: I'm not big into the idea of shrinking down to his "bigger is better"!
T-Rex: What? Noty nothing!  "I love the idea of being big into the open, and the BEHOLDERS are all, um - 'tis such a nice thing to do!"
Utahraptor: "I can't believe you're so into the idea of men not knowing what they're getting into!"
T-Rex: Nothing!

T-Rex: I love the idea of getting a firsthand experience of someone's life and just being there, and the manliness in that is instantly manly.
Utahraptor: I've heard other men are trim and like to wear their manliness in their buttocks.
T-Rex: Utahraptor!
T-Rex: I know!
T-Rex: It is a rare pleasure to be a woman of good character!
