T-Rex: I have the greatest idea for a movie!  I've said this before but this time it's for serious.

T-Rex: There's so much going on!

T-Rex: The events in this movie are completely original!  I did not know that at all!  I did not know that this movie would be so much about the FUTURE, the actions of a man years after he's 70, as opposed to just a few months after that, where he's going through his life now.  I did not know that this movie would take place in the year 65,000,000, where we turn to the future to help our generation achieve greatness, and come up with the the perfect future movie!  I did not know that a movie about today's youth was made!

Utahraptor: So what are you inventing?
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: My future self is this beautifully made, well-appointed, American Nazi factory.  I turn to the camera and say "Do you remember how the audience licks and goes along with the characters while encoding punchline letters like 'h' and a?'?"
Utahraptor: Then what happens?
T-Rex: The Nazi explosion is revealed as a completely new kind of comedy!  The end!

Narrator: LOGOSEOPHONIC COMICS
Narrator: today's logical logical logical reaction: THE END
