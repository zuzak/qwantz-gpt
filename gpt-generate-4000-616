T-Rex: It's spring soon, Dromiceiomimus! And you know what that means!

T-Rex: BIKE RACES

T-Rex: Okay, so bike safety isn't exactly a top of my list. But I do want bike culture to be the place where folks go out and bike and fun things like pool and singletrack!
Dromiceiomimus: What about bikes that sink or come out?
T-Rex: Ridiculous!

Utahraptor: You want bikes that float?
T-Rex: Well, actually, I don't know - I was just trying to figure out bike culture.

T-Rex: I believe it rolls off of my fingers. Ridiculous!
Utahraptor: That's what I think!
T-Rex: Or be it foreshadowed: bikes that float, or bikes that TEAMS of bikes that YELLOWLY BIKES...

T-Rex: ...that we can't ride because they sink?
Utahraptor: That's what I believe!
T-Rex: TEAMS of bikes that YELLOWLY ARE bikes, and I don't see how that's wrong either
