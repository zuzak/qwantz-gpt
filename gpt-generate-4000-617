T-Rex: What day of the week is it?  IT'S NOT IMPORTANT, because all that matters is that today it's time for another...

T-Rex: SECRET of the MEDICAL PROFESSION!

T-Rex: Doctors have a difficult job: you come in with symptoms and you expect a diagnosis.  And sometimes that's really hard!  Hate to break it to you, Chuckles, but there's always the chance it's all in your head.
Dromiceiomimus: There's also the chance your symptoms represent a new and terrible disease unknown to medical science!
T-Rex: And in both these scenarios it's also a good idea!

Utahraptor: And the same thing with disease with no origins.
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: We don't have any idea how diseases get made.  There's only one way to find out!
Utahraptor: And that's burying the person who made the disease!
T-Rex: Oh yeah?  DRUGS ARE ON THAT LIST.

T-Rex: I propose we call it, "The Case for Sterile Tissue Engineering".
T-Rex: It's a great book.  Anybody who doesn't want to be scientist is in luck!  His or her symptoms are of course listed, and you can't quite tell from the colouring flakes that you're a ghost.  The best you can do is shrug and try another book.
