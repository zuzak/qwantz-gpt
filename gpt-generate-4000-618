T-Rex: I have been compiling a list that I think might be of value!
T-Rex: What I have compiled is nothing less than...

T-Rex: A list of phrases you should never say because nothing good will ever come of them!

T-Rex: First on the list: "What do you mean you don't love me?"
T-Rex: I feel the same way!

Utahraptor: T-Rex, you're having a bad day!  Describe that to me!
T-Rex: Sure!

Utahraptor: Okay on to the next list!
T-Rex: "I miss you", "bro, couldn't we have been better pals earlier", and "that're the best words??".
Utahraptor: Better than that!
Utahraptor: "I can see why now that you're dead saying these words, though."

T-Rex: Man, these days I just have to say "Hey, bro, could've done that!" to anyone.  And I can see why you can't just leave it at that.
T-Rex: I had to say "How could've you, Utahraptor?"
T-Rex: Because... I had to say it.
