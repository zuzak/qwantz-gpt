T-Rex:  Hello!  We are friends on Facebook and I kinda actually have no idea who you are.  You invited me to a party in a distant city, soooo... is that where you live?

Narrator:  I GUESS WE MET SOMEWHERE ONCE?
Narrator:  a web card

T-Rex:  I looked at your profile.  I dunno.  It seems weird to say "Sorry, I've already got enough friends", but I don't really remember that you've invited me to any such shenanigans either.  Maybe you're just really nice!
Dromiceiomimus:  I didn't have any friends at all, T-Rex!
T-Rex:  I guess you just found someone interesting!  It's not like we're going to argue about it later!

Utahraptor:  That doesn't answer the question!
T-Rex:  * *

Utahraptor:  And if you think I'm creepy, then tell me why you're interested in liking me, T-Rex!
T-Rex:  * *
T-Rex:  ATTENTION FRIENDS!  YOU'RE THE STAR OF THE STORY, NOT THE SENDER OF THE SENDER COMICS

T-Rex:  You are NOT that great a friend as I remember you are
T-Rex:  sorry
T-Rex:  I meant to be more of a pal!
