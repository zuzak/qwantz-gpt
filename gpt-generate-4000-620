T-Rex: I have been compiling a list that I think will be of great value to my friends!
T-Rex: What I have compiled is nothing less than...

T-Rex: A list of all good things.

T-Rex: Things that I have learnt about myself!
T-Rex: Things which, it will be remembered, were simply good things I could have learnt.

Utahraptor: Among these, you compiled?
T-Rex: Yes!  One!

Utahraptor: And you agree that these are good things you could have learnt, all being in a single location!  You then return to your original location, this time dressed in the warm colour of modernity!
T-Rex: Oh!  And you find that, with modern conveniences, people are and always will be more social, and knowledge is bliss!

T-Rex: You have sadly lost the chance to complete the Great Library Project!
T-Rex: What?!
T-Rex: Oh, just a moment.
