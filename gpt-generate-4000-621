T-Rex: I have a great idea for a comic that'll please everyone, INCLUDING ME.

T-Rex: Okay! So all you've got to do is find a kid and make him do your favourite comic thing. All you have to do is make that thing a crappy story about how cool Christmas is!

T-Rex: THAT'S the thing!

T-Rex: If we all liked a story about how cool Christmas is, then we can just do a bunch of other stuff too!
T-Rex: Like throw some Christmas cards in, and then ask the other kids to do the same. But if we all went at it the old trick is call the other kids hungry!
Dromiceiomimus: I think you do want to do that?
T-Rex: NO! NOT ANYMORE!

Utahraptor: So what do you do?
T-Rex: I decide I'm gonna do it! Oh my gosh I hear you!

Utahraptor: So I hear you're gonna do it though. So - yes! I hear you're gonna do it.
T-Rex: Then what? Then I hear lots of other kids are gonna do it too!
Utahraptor: Then it's done! I'm done too!

Narrator: THAT NIGHT:
Neighbour: COME TO OUR PARTY, NEIGHBOUR?
T-Rex: Yes! I am! I drank too much and ate too much.
Neighbour: THAT'S EXCELLENT.
T-Rex: I know!
Neighbour: BE SURE TO SPEND YOUR TIME
