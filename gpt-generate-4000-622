T-Rex: A chicken crosses the road and everyone demands you explain why this happened!!

T-Rex: A blonde has used white out to correct a mistake on their computer screen. Regardless of hair colour, this person is to be your personal assistant.
T-Rex: A horse walks into a bar and talks to the bartender, who calmly carries on a conversation with it. Everything you thought you knew about the world is crumbling around you. You can FEEL your sanity ending.

Utahraptor: A man in a bar pulls a tiny pianist out of his pocket!
T-Rex: Again, instant insanity.

Utahraptor & T-Rex: Oh daaaaaang

T-Rex: A stranger entreats you to answer how many black lesbian transsexuals it takes to screw in a lightbulb, and you can't think of a way to answer that question without sounding like a COMPLETELY TERRIBLE PERSON.
