T-Rex: How can I possibly be late for my important meeting AGAIN?

T-Rex: How is my mind suddenly full of plans and whatnot?

Dromiceiomimus: IONS of things to do this year! Things like...
T-Rex: Rockstar's Cars?

Utahraptor: Hah! That's gross. What is?
T-Rex: Rockstar's Cars.

Utahraptor: Hah! That's gross. What is?
T-Rex: Rockstar's Cars.

T-Rex: Rockstar's trying to say SOMETHING in my ear like "Look at me, I'm 'The T-Rex'! My interior decoration has explosions coming from the back!"
Utahraptor: That makes me feel kinda bad about it?
T-Rex: I know! That makes me feel better.

The music in The background is so good and the explosions are just awesome. What could possibly go wrong?
The background vocals: it's like they're in a musical!
T-Rex: I love that smell?
The background vocals: yeah
T-Rex: This concludes my exploration of the world of Rockstar
