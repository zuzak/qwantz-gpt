T-Rex: Everyone!
T-Rex: You guys!

T-Rex: Who's in charge of telling me what to say?
Dromiceiomimus: Well T-Rex, here's the thing. When I say "So hey, I think you could've got a good reason not to hang out with me", I don't just say, "Hang on, I don't have a good reason." I suggest a good reason, not a justification.
T-Rex: Man! I don't know why you're so interested in this! Are you interested in SCIENTIFIC SCIENTISM?

Utahraptor: I'm not interested in it, T-Rex!
T-Rex: You're not.

Utahraptor: I'm not. Not now, T-Rex. Science is about finding reasons to believe things, not about pursuing those grounds to which we may not heir.
T-Rex: That was a good lecture, Utahraptor! I'm - I'm not interested in it now. I'm just going to pretend.
Utahraptor: Oh, it was a good lecture. It may be that you're not a good enough T-Rex to be science!

God: I THINK YOU ARE A REASONABLE REASONABLE T-REX
T-Rex: But it's not a reason why I'm NOT a good enough T-Rex to be a science.
God: T-REX I THINK YOU ARE
God: STOP
God: I WOULDN'T REALLY HELP
