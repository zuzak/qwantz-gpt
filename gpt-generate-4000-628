T-Rex: You know what they say: you can't take it with you!  You can't really take it with you!

T-Rex: Futurism!  You can't really take it with you!

T-Rex: Right!  You're not allowed to take things with you; that means you can't joke about them.  So all you can do is joke about CAPTAIN HORSE.  But his jokes were pretty terrible, so when he appeared again, this stupid "come quick" went unnoticed.  So instead he went for it!  Oh no, now I'm worried my own fragile masculinity is going to be made manifest.

Utahraptor: That's a very disappointing turn!
T-Rex: As usual!

Utahraptor: It's the ladies!  She's always the lead character and she's not afraid to joke.  Her confidence in her abilities and her determination to make life in the world easier for everyone is something to be excited about!
T-Rex: Hah!  Imagine how great things will be if you attend a Women in the World panel and she shows up with a smile!  Imagine what she'll be able to do if she gets in her car and drives away?!

Narrator: THIS COMIC BROUGHT TO YOU BY T-REX, BY THE WAY:
T-Rex: A woman in the audience!  Who we assume is really bad at joking!  So I-
T-Rex: I love jokes!
