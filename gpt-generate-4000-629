T-Rex: I've thought of the best story!

T-Rex: NOT A HARD STORY

T-Rex: SO IMPORTANT!  I make it my business to write about it, and despite my best efforts, only write stories that people will think are at least worthwhile telling.  It's a fragile and fragile format!
T-Rex: I'm not certain that's the case. I could make a really good story about my parents, I might be good, but that's not important.  Storytelling is about progression, and the person who does not keep their mouth shut and keeps their foot on the pillow, the frozen silent spectator in the drama, is the person they choose.

Utahraptor: Well, I think your story is more about your parents choosing a narrative!
T-Rex: That's true!

Utahraptor: And it makes more sense if you think about what kind of person they are.  You're not that person at parent-level.  You have a non-statutory role model parent!
T-Rex: True!  Of parent-level.
Utahraptor: Ah.  But you're treating your child like a real person, just like Picard did.  No, I don't know better.

T-Rex: PERSONALLY, I am having troubles with ACTUAL, NOT LIMITED SIZING ADDRESSES.  They're all "hey, I use a girl name" and I don't know why.
T-Rex: I don't!
T-Rex: PLEASE TRY TO FOCUS ON THEM ENSIAL RELEASES ON MY FACE
