T-Rex: I have a problem! Okay, so

T-Rex: I feel like I'm getting ahead of myself sometimes. I feel like I have no control over what I do, and that has an outsized effect on who I am as a person!
Dromiceiomimus: You were thinking of starting a family...a corporate one?
T-Rex: Yeah, but you're treating the people around you like a second class citizen! Isn't this just trying to make yourself seem cool?

Utahraptor: So you don't feel like you have any influence!
T-Rex: No, but I did a search of Wikipedia and you sure have been following me around!

T-Rex: And you'll find me re-tweaking vegetables all the time! Okay? I may get a few of these "cannibals" in my future, just to keep my current facade of coolness.
Utahraptor: I don't see why we have to do this.
T-Rex: I'll just enjoy the treats!

Narrator: LATER: T-REX GETS CANDYED BY AN UNSTOPPABLE PAST CHICKEN RELIGION!
T-Rex: Oh no! Am I now the celebrity crush who everyone hates? Hilarious!
