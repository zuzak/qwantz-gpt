T-Rex: I am a man who doesn't know a lot of basic things about himself. I barely know what colour my eyes are!

T-Rex: O- Orange? Deep saffron? GAMBOGE?

T-Rex: But there's tons of other stuff I've never bothered to memorize too! When I'm eating dinner, I stare at my body as a gorgeous woman is having sex intercourse with me, absolutely NO PROBLEM. I do it sometimes.

Utahraptor: You're talking about this guy you've never met?
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: He's both handsome AND pretty sexy, and he drinks coffee when he's having a cup.
Utahraptor: Aw, he's just a guy!
T-Rex: He's just a guy who wants to sell you some coffee, and he's a guy who doesn't always get it.

Narrator: CONGRATULATIONS
Narrator: TO THE GROCERISTIC ANTS OF THE FUTURE!
T-Rex: This is what happens if we go back in time!
Future T-Rex: I've got to get back to you, you know?
Future T-Rex: This is what I've got to do!
Future Utahraptor: I can't let you do it!
T-Rex: I CAN, but I've got to go back in time and tell you that I've decided this is a pretty big deal.  I'm gonna get kicked out of parties, and also, this is what I've been meaning to myself for years.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!
T-Rex: What the hell, it was all downhill from there!
