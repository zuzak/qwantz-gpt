T-Rex: My new book is a collection of fairy tales.

T-Rex: A collection of fairy tales that, despite their otherwise fantastic title, HAPPENED real quick to be BORING.

T-Rex: For example! Dromiceiomimus, you're a horror writer! Are you writing a story about a man who locks lips with a woman, and then gets mad?
Dromiceiomimus: Probably, T-Rex!
T-Rex: EXACTLY. Are you haunting me with the sound of my voice?
Dromiceiomimus: Probably, T-Rex!

Utahraptor: Your book is a collection of SONG lyrics?
T-Rex: Yeah, EXACTLY.

Utahraptor: Yeah, and it's more of a collection of BORING'S.
T-Rex: And it's a collection of songs that are free and unrestricted, and that if you were to least try to hear them, you'd get no more fairy tales than you did now.
Utahraptor: I - okay?

T-Rex: Well - um, enjoy the fairy tales, because -
T-Rex: I just -
T-Rex: I just don't get what you're saying
