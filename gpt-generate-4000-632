T-Rex: If you want to know what the universe is like, you need to visit the internet.

T-Rex: That's a bad thing!  If you want to know when it's done being dated, you'll find it by going to the internet.

T-Rex: There, I gave you this image of a universe that's getting older.  But don't worry, there's a lot going on!  If you want to know when the next film will be like this, you'll need to visit the internet.
Dromiceiomimus: But what about when you're 20 and back?
T-Rex: That's still not the case.  You may be surprised to see this stuff happen, but you'll be too now!

Utahraptor: So you'll stop?
T-Rex: Yep!  But don't worry, we've tried.  Our bodies are different, younger, and usually sexier than yours!

T-Rex: Mine are, on the whole, a more mature and awesome sex life.  But you could be regretting what you did that day, years from now!  You know that one already!
Utahraptor: Ooh!  Alright, I'll try!  I'm going to visit the internet now!

T-Rex: Yes!  I'll visit the encyclopedia now!  And when I visit the internet I'll write a sex joke for people who'll then maybe get to meet someone who I think is HOT, and then when they're done being HOT, I'll come back to the future and tell them I think they're a winner.
T-Rex: Everyone, if you're going to do that, I'm you!  I'm you!
