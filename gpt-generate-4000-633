T-Rex: How do I feel about matrimony?
Utahraptor: I love weddings! It's someone else's party and I can cry if I want to!

Utahraptor: I think the biggest problem we've got is someone trying to control a spouse while also making it very evident that the spouse is the one non-ceiiial thing that can't theed herself.
T-Rex: I know! I think we've got a great actor for the lady next door who can do that.

T-Rex: I love the idea of someone who can mess with your spouse's heart valve AND get away with it.
Utahraptor: I know.
T-Rex: I love that!
T-Rex: I'm dropping the "mistress" metaphor and treating "theed" like an actual noun.

T-Rex:That's the best "persona" there is to be seen, Utahraptor! It's got potential!
Utahraptor: For reals, I suggest we talk about spouse elements?
T-Rex: Yeah, it's got potential.
