T-Rex: What we think is good is relative! It gives us an idea of what a good thing to do, and gives us the ability to make that bad decision AGAIN.

T-Rex: It's like a lottery, right? And what do the winners be? The lottery being random, the rest of the world not getting a single jackpot!

T-Rex: That's what I'm convinced, Dromiceiomimus! I am convinced that relative things are relative.
Dromiceiomimus: I know, I know, I'm not sure there's any advantage to being a relative person.
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, relative things are all about the relative being a relative dude! All the other dudes are taken.

Utahraptor: Dude, relative things are all about relative guys!
T-Rex: Absolutely!

T-Rex: "A downer dude," said Said this jerk, "I'm going to dedicate my life towards establishing a mean run in front of God. And this will be the first of my kind horse", etc. This is what we're hearing about this jerk.
Utahraptor: Yeah, we're hearing about this jerk.
T-Rex: Yes, relative dudes are all about mean run numbers in front of God.

God: T-REX DO YOU WANT TO HAVE ALL THE FUN
God: I CAN MAKE SURE THAT WASN'T IN BRILLIANCE
God: THE WORDS HAVE FALLEN IN FRANCE T-REX
God: I CAN MAKE THOSE
God: AND I CAN MAKE THEM EVEN WORTH IT
