T-Rex: Well, I certainly don't have all the details on my new fantastic story!  But, I do know that I would be a very good friend!

T-Rex: I would be a very good friend, Dromiceiomimus!  I would be a very good friend, Dromiceiomimus.

Utahraptor: I'd be a good friend, T-Rex!
T-Rex: You're right!

Utahraptor: I'd also be a very good friend, because I'd want to help you with your adventures, and try to help you out in any way possible.
T-Rex: That's exactly what I was going to say!  But - you know, that kind of advice's kind of AWFUL to the touch.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hey, Utahraptor!  My story's about a very good friend who gets turned by a desperate woman and is unable to turn from her heart of hearts.
Utahraptor: Aww!  That's a little too...complicated for my liking.
