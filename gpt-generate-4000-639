T-Rex: A lot of folks wonder what the future will be like! This is dumb of them because if they asked me I guess I would have said the same thing, but I've got a new job and a totally different life!

God: WORK IN TO THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: Wait, does that mean we'll be able to work in the same timeburdens? Because there's bound to be some differences, and some folks will THINK the same thing, and some things will be the same, and some things will be different.
God: NO THAT'S GREAT
T-Rex: ...is it? What difference does it make a life of difference?

Utahraptor: Wait, I answered my question!
T-Rex: It makes no difference!

Utahraptor: I just wanted to say: it's a great idea, and I think it's brilliant, and my friend Utahraptor thinks it's the best thing ever!
T-Rex: Really? Are you interested in becoming... President of the United States?
Utahraptor: No, not really!  I was hoping to avoid that whole thing.

T-Rex: Well, this has been quite the adventure so far AND for such a fine party of people! It seems that, for the first time, we've got an old friend discussing politics with a young age group that is all well and good, but then one stupid mistake leaves a bad taste in their mouth!
T-Rex: I'd better go visit him, because we can't be friends now!

Narrator: SHORTLY:
T-Rex: Oui oui tout le monde - et ca n' arret pas elle fait une chapeau!
