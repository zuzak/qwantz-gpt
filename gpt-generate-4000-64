T-Rex: What day of the week is it?  IT'S NOT IMPORTANT, because all that matters is that today it's time for another...

T-Rex: SECRET of the MEDICAL PROFESSION!

T-Rex: Doctors have a difficult job: you come in with symptoms and you expect a diagnosis.  And sometimes that's really hard!  Hate to break it to you, Chuckles, but there's always the chance it's all in your body.
Dromiceiomimus: There's also the chance your symptoms represent a new and terrible disease unknown to medical science!
T-Rex: And in both these cases a new and different doctor may come in for very different reasons!

T-Rex: And with their added wrinkle of a "presumably" this means they're more likely to charge you for your call and report on changes in your body!
Utahraptor: And this means you can expect a price increase, for the insurance you provide!

T-Rex: Yes Utahraptor!  And this means you can handle a much more complicated case!  For example, you may be charged a "hush boy"!  And this means you should prepare for a gentleman's fashion show!
Utahraptor: And you'll wear a fancy "hush girl"!
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: And if there's a problem, try saying "Doctors, I have a problem!  Should I worry about my new skills, or worry about a new and terrible disease?  I just told you the truth: I worry about my new skills."
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: Alright so I just did it and I'ma do it again
