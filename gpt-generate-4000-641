T-Rex: In my new video game, you control a girl who loves to jump and spin things, and then have her do these giant robot suits. And each suit has different stats, but they're all doing the same thing:

T-Rex: Hatching!

T-Rex: You fight her and out-KILLING her, she jumps and spins to avoid you. Then she dies, and her suit is what she used to fight the next time. And this is where, you know, story mode actually ends.
T-Rex: Also, her suit lets her fly.

Utahraptor: And this is where custom ROMs come in?
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: And you have your own problem where if you want her to fight you, you just need to make her jump and shoot bullets from her hands, right? And also, vanilla? And it's not like there's anything better than F2P game over here.
Utahraptor: I'm not convinced game over here.
T-Rex: Vanilla is the best.

Narrator: A FEW MINUTES LATER:
T-Rex: Oh hey, is she in pain?
Devil: MOPE TALKING EACH SINGLE PANEL IS A LITTLE BAD DUDE SO I'M PLAYING INTERNET UNIVERSE ON ACCOUNT OF MY GOOD FRIENDSHIP
T-Rex: Oh really?  Is everyone on Twitter dead?
Devil: I ASSURE YOU SO
