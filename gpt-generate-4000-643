T-Rex: With a grin on his horribly twisted face, Professor Death activates his Death Ray, directing its powerful radiation towards the city!!

T-Rex: Which was great, because his eponymous Death Ray increases overall heath and wellness!

T-Rex: And as we all know, people's names or what they look like obviously don't determine the kind of person who gets to write the title of that article. Professor Death was a kind and benevolent inventor, unlike CAPTAIN LIBERTY, a handsome and sexy super-awful villain who kept trying to stymie Professor Death's plans!
Dromiceiomimus: That's just so typical of him. God.
T-Rex: Captain Liberty, give it a rest.

Utahraptor: Good, Captain Liberty!
T-Rex: I'm already half-way there!

Captain Liberty: We all know about your plan, T-Rex! You tried to stymie my plans by bluffing!
T-Rex: And yet, I'm still glad I gave you the chance!
Utahraptor: Well, about that... you seemed a little more cheezed than sincere. Boy, did I ever love you!

T-Rex: I... guess I did!
T-Rex: I guess I did, yeah
