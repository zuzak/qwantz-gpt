T-Rex: In my new story, Professor Time teams up with her colleague, Doctor Space. Together, they are...
T-Rex: TIME!

T-Rex: Their combination house/fort is called the Space-Time Continuum.

T-Rex: It is a continuous universe with everything going on just above a horizon they created with the hopes of eventually running up and down the side!
Utahraptor: Or so they thought!

Utahraptor: But they never did!
T-Rex: I always thought our universe was better than the one we had, even though I never claimed to have created it!
Utahraptor: I even had the time to save the universe from the bullets of Progress.

T-Rex: What a shame!
