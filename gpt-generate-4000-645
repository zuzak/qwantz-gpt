T-Rex: It's always struck me as weird that genres developed when they did: when they developed like Mary Poppins and then, years later, you realized that whatever "cult" was was going on was really just Mary Poppins and then, years later, you realized that whatever "cult" was going on was really just Mary Poppins!

T-Rex: This is something I just realized: that's how come I'm in charge of my time!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I'm deeply sorry to hear this. I've effectively decided that whatever Mary Poppins were, they were never in fact the people we were trying to get here. We did them "fresh" and "hard", Dromiceiomimus. We replaced the leaf with the stem, and created Species Anthropomorphism. We replaced Mary Poppins with things like "Mary Poppins", and then, we rewrote the laws of the farm with Mary Poppins. We ourselves are Anthropomorphized, the Mary Poppins of our own creation.

Utahraptor: And what of Mary Poppins herself?
T-Rex: THE PRAYER OF PRAYERS!

Utahraptor: Poppins herself don't exactly sound like superheroes! "Poppins". How is that not heresy, Utahraptor? They're superheroes all the way through, but then she gets crucified for not praying enough! It was not a pleasant experience.
T-Rex: I, um, find fault with the name "Poppycock" and feel it proper.

Narrator: THE END
