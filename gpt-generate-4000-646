T-Rex: Attention, folks with low self-esteem!

T-Rex: Pretty sure you've got no-one to blame for that but yourself, but the world around you!

T-Rex: And if you blame others, it can be really hard for you to adjust to! Have you never been sad before?
T-Rex: I hope so! I'm so happy for you, Dromiceiomimus! And I'm also relieved to hear that you're not sad and that the things that hurt you are finally forgiven!

Utahraptor: Sweeps, let's look at our Heros!
T-Rex: Neat!

T-Rex: But here's one idea: worse than that is what we're doing to her, cheating on her, and that's gonna cost us our jobs!
Utahraptor: That's a good idea, though! We should all be concerned about what we're doing to her.
T-Rex: No, you know what we do best?
Utahraptor: I throw out gross pieces of paper that say "She's Evil Shemale."

T-Rex: That's gross and incorrect! This is like throwing a party, alone, with your hands up. You know what she's doing to you?
T-Rex: Eating.
T-Rex: And, that's only because I've been putting down the cash!
