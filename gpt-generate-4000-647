T-Rex: I am a guy who just turned 30. He's been hanging out all day and us hang out all year round.

T-Rex: It's not that he's changed, it's that he's kept going back to the same times, still trying to get better.

T-Rex: He's pretty great, you guys! It's been like a decade or so since we last saw each other, and since then we've been pals everywhere.
Utahraptor: Yeah, but he's not... great?
T-Rex: I'm not great, Utahraptor! Not in the sense of being ultimate chumps, but in the sense that I've somehow avoided meeting him for the very first time.

T-Rex: I thought we'd have a good time making out, you know? Mostly, anyway.
T-Rex: It was fine!
