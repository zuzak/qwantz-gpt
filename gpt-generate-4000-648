Narrator: T-REX IN: "PRESENTISM"

T-Rex: Presentism is when you interpret the historical past with a view from the present!

T-Rex: Its danger is not just that it is often self-congratulatory, but also that judging historical figures by present-day moral standards is likely not a fruitful line of inquiry. What we see as questionable (say, sexism!) would have seemed completely routine to someone brought up in such a time, and we can't really blame historical figures, I think, for not questioning it!

Utahraptor: This seems awfully close to ethical relativism!
T-Rex: Huh?

Utahraptor: Well, aren't you saying we can't judge historical figures in a modern context, because they lived their lives during different times? But then there's a whole new set of problems that can't be solved by just judging present moments with a view to 'the past'!
T-Rex: Aw, man! Then I am gonna go easy on him!

T-Rex: If he bothers to take a picture of me, I'll get mad: sort of?
Utahraptor: Yeah, I'd meet him at a restaurant!
T-Rex: He might say, "Oh, I'm just the reporter here. What'd you get?'"
T-Rex: "I was just the reporter! I'm the one who recorded you. I say that only to prove I'm not a friggin' cheezed-off old man! All the while, I'm walking by you, Domiceiomimus.

T-Rex: "'[is] no escapade'?" you say, cradling the camera in your hand.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, you're my brother, and you're... Domiceiomimus?
T-Rex: QUIT MAKING OUT WITH ME, I'M SORRY I'M NEVER PLAYING VIDEO GAMES EVER AGAIN
