T-Rex: I have a Problem!  How can I possibly be of help, when there is nothing anyone can help me with a simple complaint?

T-Rex: It occurs to me that my stream of consciousness is drowning.  I have a stream, Dromiceomimus!

T-Rex: I understand: you've been lost in a sea of consciousness.  But it's clear that you've been replaced by something else: a new, more advanced form of consciousness known only as "my stream of consciousness".
Dromiceomimus: A new consciousness, T-Rex.
T-Rex: A new, more advanced form of consciousness!  We all have to find out the full story.

Utahraptor: Are you really that worried that people will become lost in a sea of consciousness-inducing chemicals, if not cure all diseases?
T-Rex: Who?

Utahraptor: I just thought that if you get enough consciousness,things will move on their own.  It's not like we're going to start seeing cure all cases of disease in the next world.
T-Rex: Well, I suppose that is fair.  In that case, I will be the first.  Next, you shall be followed by me, Dromiceomimus.
Utahraptor: Stop!
Utahraptor: This is a very terrible idea.

T-Rex: Let us proceed, Utahraptor!  Are you alright?
Utahraptor: I'm fine!
T-Rex: Let us proceed, Utahraptor!  Are you alright?
Utahraptor: I'm not!  I'm holding the bag!

T-Rex: Hold on, I'm holding the bag!
