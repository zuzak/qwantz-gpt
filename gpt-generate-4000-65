T-Rex: So...

T-Rex: Polygamy!

T-Rex: I've discovered that the problem with researching this sort of thing (polygamy) (the subject of which I am speaking) is that everybody has an agenda!
T-Rex: It's like vegetarianism: all you hear is from the militant extremes ("Meat is Murder!" "Vegetarians are Sissies") and it's hard to find a balanced viewpoint!

Utahraptor: Have you tried reading multiple sources and, then synthesizing your own viewpoint?

Utahraptor: You are reading about polygamy, after all.
Utahraptor: You know "more than one partner" ... "more than one book" ...
Utahraptor: Polygamy!

T-Rex: Polygamous READING? What's next?
T-Rex: Eh?
T-Rex: "What's next?"
