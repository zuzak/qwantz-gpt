T-Rex: I have a problem!  This is me -

T-Rex: this is T-Rex!  I just saw his computer ruined!

T-Rex: I don't even know what's going on with this!

Dromiceiomimus: I think he's moved from New York to Los Angeles, and I think he's angry that I moved to his place, but I didn't even know where he was.  And I thought he was gone, but then I looked up and he was gone too, and I looked back and I just knew it was too late.  I didn't realize how much you indebted him, Dromiceiomimus!  I don't even know what he is.  I'm so shocked!

T-Rex: So I'm - I'm going home to be SORRY if I ever see him!
Utahraptor: Who?

Utahraptor: Who is it?  Is it -

T-Rex: It's funny, because I think it's funny because... I don't know.  It's funny because of my racisms, because of how I've been unable to separate the hurt I've done from the words I've used in the past.  It's very true to who I am now!
Utahraptor: Wow.  It hurts me to see you say that stuff!  You should be thanking me.

T-Rex: Ha ha!
