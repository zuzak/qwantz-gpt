Narrator: TORN by NATALIE IMBRUGLIA

T-Rex: Nat Imbruglia has witnessed something terrible happen.  And it's happening right now and she's worried...
T-Rex: ... for her safety.

T-Rex: Nat Imbruglia's only son, Nat Wild Imbruglia, is under arrest for murder.  But his father, Wild Imbruglia, is also under arrest for murder.  And this is why Nat is terrified!  Nat wonders if she'll ever get what she's done in life.
T-Rex: Is she going to get - get - executed?

Utahraptor: No way, she says!  She knows what she's doing.
T-Rex: What? No. NO. NO I'm doing the ACT.

Utahraptor: The bullet went through Nat's chest!
T-Rex: Oh no, it went through Nat's chest too.  I don't want to do that!  This is what happens when you transgress the power of the BABY GOD.
Utahraptor: Not bad, though.  I suppose.
