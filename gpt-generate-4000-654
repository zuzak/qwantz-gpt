T-Rex: Today is a good day I think to talk about phlogiston!

T-Rex: Who built phlogiston?

T-Rex: The geode was a piece of piece of piece of piece with a piston and a timing block! It was on top of the other geodeslets to give the added resistance of a contact metal!
T-Rex: Looks like you out like you're stomping on this guy right now!

Utahraptor: That's pretty phlogistonolate, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It sure is!

T-Rex: With that in mind, I have started a new philosophy: the end-point of all phlogistonol hashed, philosophy. Check it out:
T-Rex: Monotheism!

T-Rex: philosophy is when you accept all that there is something wrong with the phlogiston!
Utahraptor: Like what?
T-Rex: Like she's walking on egg, and the phlogiston is right in the middle?
Utahraptor: Yeah, and the entire thing is a fake T-Rex illustration?
Utahraptor: It's beautiful!

T-Rex: Hey! Check it out:
T-Rex: SONG ONE:
