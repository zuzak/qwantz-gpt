T-Rex: I have been assuming that we will live for millions of years!  If not then I fear the long and the hard path of mortality I have been warning us about!  Here is what I have been warning myself about!

T-Rex: First things's first!  DINOSAUR COMICS PRESENTS: "LITTLE PROTOHIN"

Narrator: SECONDS LATER:
Dromiceiomimus: I had thought you might enjoy corn flakes, T-Rex!  But I can't get corn flakes on my lips anymore because I've got a cold.  I'm stuck in winter where I can't get any air in my lungs!
T-Rex: Fair enough!  Now I can get all my air through my FACE.

Utahraptor: I've also got colds through my SHOULDER.
T-Rex: Me too!  Again.

T-Rex: Dear Diary, I am writing to say that the worst cold I've ever had is an "other", an "other", as you know, as recently as I can remember.  I've been dreaming!  I'm preparing to wake with sweats coming out of my face.  The memory of what I went through will haunt me for the rest of my life.
Utahraptor: And yet, here's the exciting part!  I'll be remembered for the sweat and the bile and the stink and the scatology!

T-Rex: Alternatively, I'll be remembered for the little thing, the sound of my voice breaking on the impact, the scrape of my teeth between the scratches of my leather, the taste of my mouth, the movement of my limbs as I tumble over the scrapes of metal I didn't even steel!
T-Rex: Then it's settled!
