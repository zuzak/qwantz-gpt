T-Rex: You guys, what if reincarnation is real?!

T-Rex: I'm going to make history!

T-Rex: First, you're gonna have to show that people can come back from hell and do the same thing, but the new law of thermodynamics is still 1. When I invent a new thing, I'm gonna get REALLY excited.  And in my new thing EVALUATES CHAIRPLACE temperature, so it's not hard to see how people's original thermostats got destroyed!  And also how heat reflects off them, which again, is hard to simulate.

Utahraptor: And these gases aren't simulations, T-Rex!
T-Rex: They're real!

Utahraptor: Yep!  And I kinda want to call Ricky and ask for help, but I figure that when it's all said and done, I've got nothing left.
T-Rex: What I'll say is is is is is my last dream.  A lie.
Utahraptor: Ricky, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean for that.

T-Rex: Actually, yes, I'm very sorry.
T-Rex: I always forget how they get us out of this stupid couch!
