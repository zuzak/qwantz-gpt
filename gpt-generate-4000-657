Narrator: FRUSTRATION COMICS
T-Rex: I have never been robbed, and yet, I feel as if money is a nice gesture!

T-Rex: Money is appreciated as a means of exchange!

T-Rex: It is a true good, and indeed, a very good thing!
T-Rex: So much for that obvious truth, Dromiceiomimus! Money is just currency!
Dromiceiomimus: It's true, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I appreciate the sentiment.

Utahraptor: You're a little upset by the name of currency, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Not really! I was just upset that the name "money" seemed like something I'd to had some sort of relationship with.

Utahraptor: Well, you're a pretty good guy, and a good thing too!
T-Rex: I'm not! Not for me, Utahraptor! For me, and for all those around me!
Utahraptor: I'm not for you!
T-Rex: HEY!
Utahraptor: T-Rex! For me, huh?

T-Rex: You know what? For me, I just want to be your friend, and to be your friend, and to be happy that we're friends.
T-Rex: Hah!
T-Rex: Looks like we're loved.
