T-Rex: I have some bad news, everyone.  The game I'm finishing right now is WORTH IT!

T-Rex: You tell me it's being used as a dig word, Dromiceiomimus!

Dromiceiomimus: Yes, but all you've done is remind people that you're "T-Rex" from the original game!  That's not very useful.
T-Rex: I'm not!  I digress.

Utahraptor: What's the problem we're having with T-Rex now?  Why wouldn't he just change his name to "Arthur Khan" instead?
T-Rex: Nothing!

Utahraptor: T-Rex's a pretty good name, but his address is way more convenient!  Khan's Business Improvement Corporation.
T-Rex: Huh.  I guess I just don't like the whole idea of "Khan's Business Improvement Corporation".
Utahraptor: I'll give you that.  What's the name of your organization?

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Business Improvement Corporation!
Utahraptor: That's not good business idea!
Utahraptor: What IS good idea is to emulate the aesthetics and values of your worst work, T-Rex!

T-Rex: What IS good idea is to make that worst work be fun and watch it get better!  Dancing around in a box for as long as you're concerned!
T-Rex: THAT WORKS FOR CHILDREN, I DEFINITELY KNOW
