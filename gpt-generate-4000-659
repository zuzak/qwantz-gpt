T-Rex: Dating both twin sisters at the same time:

T-Rex: Hot? Or just, in fact, KIND OF WEIRD?

T-Rex: I'm afraid that I fall on the "kind of weird" side of the fence this time. While I'm usually in favour of the hot makeouts, they're sisters! It's like they've made out with each other, through proxy. Transitive makeouts!

Utahraptor: I really don't see how you're getting this!
T-Rex: What's not to get? Twins! Proxies! Transitive closure!

Utahraptor: Well it's just - if you were a dude dating, say, identical twin sister swim-team captains, I can imagine you reacting a little differently.
T-Rex: Things would indeed be different...

NARRATOR: FANTASY LAND:
T-Rex: Keep on swimmin', ladies, because I love you both super equally!
T-Rex: I DON'T KNOW WHO I ARE, ACTUALLY.
