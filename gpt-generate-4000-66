T-Rex: Who here wants to watch me eat a sandwich?
God: SURE
T-Rex: Dude, straight-up sex!

God: I'M NOT INTO ZING
T-Rex: You're into it! You want to see me eat a sandwich.

T-Rex: No, but you're not into sandwich sex! I'm into that awesome "how to eat a sandwich but also look good, clean your throat, pass the time, maybe have a hot shower" routine.
Dromiceiomimus: We invented that!
T-Rex: YEAH I invented it!

Utahraptor: I'm wondering if you - you ever wear pants during sandwich sex?
T-Rex: Dude, they're super embarrassing!

Utahraptor: I know! It's a popular idea!
T-Rex: It's a popular idea! COME ON!
Utahraptor: I'm not wearing pants during sandwich sex!
T-Rex: Oh man, are you going to tell me what you think?

Narrator: THAT EVENING...
T-Rex: I'm going to stub my toe... ALL THE TIME!
