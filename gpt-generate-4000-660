T-Rex: I just realized that no women have ever worked as an accounting professional, and I'm sad that that is no longer the case!

T-Rex: Luckily, I've got the perfect solution!

T-Rex: I will become incredibly happy and totally female!  I will be happy and totally happy.  I will be happy and totally happy.
T-Rex: I'll be CRAZY.

Utahraptor: You'll be CRAZY!
T-Rex: With this new happiness, am I?

Utahraptor: With the knowledge that if I worked as an accounting person I could make myself look good and make myself laugh, I could make myself look bad?  I am so ready to make life changes for the sake of doing so!  I am so ready to change jobs, careers, and lives!

T-Rex: Whoooo!  Hey, here I come!
T-Rex: CRAZY!!
