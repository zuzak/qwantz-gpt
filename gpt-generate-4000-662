Narrator: excuse me
T-Rex: Ethics and morals are not the same thing!

T-Rex: But they ARE the foundation of morality!

T-Rex: . . . and if I don't live life to the fullest, then I don't get married! Philosophical marriage, I think, is the ultimate expression of ethics and of science and of religion.
T-Rex: I've got the whole deal!

T-Rex: . . . in my wallet!
Utahraptor: I don't live at my desk!

Utahraptor: I live on your couch!
