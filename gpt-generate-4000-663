T-Rex: I am on the lookout for a new friend.  A new, more ultimate friend: the best friend ever.

T-Rex: I am on the lookout for science, personified!

T-Rex: It will be so awesome, Dromiceiomimus!  I will be able to apply the laws of logic to the innermost workings of my universe.  And, I will have an innermost secret: I will keep secrets!
Dromiceiomimus: Will this be the secret to remaining completely anonymous?
T-Rex: INTERESTING.

Utahraptor: You're on the lookout for a secret, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Sure!

Utahraptor: So what's this thing called the "fourth sense" thing again, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Uh, the sense of an unknowable "pantygated basement"??
Utahraptor: Yep!  That one's pretty tantalizing, plus it's freaky awesome if you don't say "fourth sense"!

T-Rex: OH MY GOD, CAN'T NOT SAY THAT AGAIN!  I WILL, ONCE AGAIN, say "fourth sense" in SECRET GENDER.  Man!  I can't keep up this constant jerky teasing!
T-Rex: Y-you're being kind of a sucky kid, my friend!
