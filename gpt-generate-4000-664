T-Rex: In the 60s the CIA was experimenting with cats.  They were making spy cats!

T-Rex: SPY CATS, you guys!

T-Rex: But rather than giving cats adorable little matching suits and attach? cases, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN AWESOME, they instead cut one open, implanted a battery and a microphone, and turned his tail into an antenna.
Dromiceiomimus: A primitive cyborg?
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: The plan was that the cat could listen in on sensitive conversations completely unnoticed!
Utahraptor: Did it work?

T-Rex: Well, they spent over five years and fifteen million dollars on it, but in the first and only field test Cyborgocat wandered onto the street, got run over by a cab, and was killed instantly.
Utahraptor: Ouch.
T-Rex: And then the project was dismantled.

T-Rex: It was a lot of money wasted, HOWEVER the project was named "Operation Acoustic Kitty", which is ADORABLE.  The moral of the story is this: whoever was in charge of naming secret CIA projects in the 60s was doing their job super well!
T-Rex: THE END.
