T-Rex: What should I do if I have a problem, God?
God: MMMM
God: WHAT

T-Rex: Guys!

God: T-REX YOU'RE THE WORST THING EVER IN HEARING
T-Rex: Yeah, seriously?
God: OH WOW THAT'S EVEN WORSE THAN CHEAT
God: THAT'S REALLY THE WORST THING EVER IN HAVING THIS INIT

T-Rex: I've been working on it! This is way better than the other ones too! Cause I'm serious: if I ever get a problem like that, I'll just make sure that nobody gets hurt by it, because WHO WANTS TO BE SITTING IT?
God: I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT
T-Rex: Seriously?

Utahraptor: Besides, if you don't see what's bad, folks will start getting these problems.
T-Rex: Sure! I've got some opinions!

Utahraptor: Why not just ask that everybody solve their problems?
T-Rex: ARGH! I started this as a message to all my friends that sex is fun, but I'm a sissy! SOMETHING is wrong with me and I'm asking you to solve its root causes by now.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Shit, no! What root causes are there?
Utahraptor: I'm pretty sure there's issues of size and self-esteem!
T-Rex: You're being kind of a sucky slipper!

Narrator: THAT NIGHT:
T-Rex: I don't get it! His address was wrong. It's his SISTER'S PIT.
