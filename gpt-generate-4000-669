Narrator: HOW TO USE WIKIPEDIA
T-Rex: Wikipedia is great if you want to know facts about something, but especially if you want to know who the popular imagination is with you? Well, this is your chance!

T-Rex: You need an imagination!

T-Rex: Luckily, it's free and open, and if you don't do anything other people think is cool, then you're not needed! Your only need is social media, which has exploded in the past few years, and free, so everyone can do whatever they want!
Dromiceiomimus: And maybe you need a Twitter account?
T-Rex: It's that easy! I'll tell you why: just follow the links!

Utahraptor: Okay, but now you're probably using Twitter a lot, right?
T-Rex: No problem!

T-Rex: Now say I'm a celebrity and I want to follow people I disagree with or who are hurt by people Iyy do business with! Do I delete some accounts and share my inclinations? Or will I merge my brands into a single banner ad: a brand I put up on Twitter?
Utahraptor: These are all options I've chosen, dude. You don't have to do this.
