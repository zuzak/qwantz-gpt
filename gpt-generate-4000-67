T-Rex: I've been thinking about time travel lately!
God: YOU THINK ABOUT TIME TRAVEL CONSTANTLY
T-Rex: That's true; I AM pretty great!

T-Rex: And it occurs to me that time travel will revolutionize the social sciences!

T-Rex: For the first time ever these "social" sciences can become true hard-core sciences: we'll be able to do EXPERIMENTS.  Go back in time to an interesting economic situation and see how different solutions work!  We'll finally be able to control initial conditions!
Dromeciomimus: I agree!

Utahraptor: But then we'll have to pay people to go back in time!
T-Rex: Again, they'll be charged with "going back in time" and so altering initial conditions to be GOOD.

Utahraptor: These "changes" will have an important bearing on how our science is understood!
T-Rex: Yes!  It is a basis upon which all future scholarship will be concluded.

T-Rex: I therefore suspend the search for a causally-unified truth, or God, and invoke the wonders of time travel!
T-Rex: As you have obviously noticed, my friends, my scientific theories have not been universally popular.
