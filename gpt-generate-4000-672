T-Rex: You know those guys who go to the dentist? I could stand on one, I just would like to see what they've done with their teeth.

T-Rex: I know they've been through dentist's surgery a hundred times, you guys!

T-Rex: I just want to be their dentist, you know? I want to see what it's like!
Utahraptor: Maybe you'd like to come over for a "meetup"!

T-Rex: I've been going to the dentist once, and he's nice, but he doesn't have a press kit. Maybe if he had one he'd give me a squeezebox!
Utahraptor: A squeezebox!
T-Rex: A squeegee box!
Utahraptor: A box that says "DON'T MISS OUT" and comes with a note that says "IF YOU DID GET THE PROBLEM OF ROMANTIC EXCHANGE THEN YOU WILL DEFINITELY WANT TO KNOW".

T-Rex: Aww! That is a true T-Rex.
Utahraptor: My break!
Utahraptor: That is true
