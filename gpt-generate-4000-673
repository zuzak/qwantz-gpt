Narrator: THE THUNDER-LIZARD'S COMICS
T-Rex: Man!  I can't remember a time when I wasn't worried about what the other kids were doing in the kitchen!

T-Rex: And that's doing it again!

T-Rex: This time, we're dealing with a confused and stressed-out baby.
Dromiceiomimus: Don't say that, T-Rex! I'll say that anyway
T-Rex: I'm PRETTY SURE I know what I'm doing! I don't even have to look away!

Utahraptor: He looks upset!  look around him!
T-Rex: HE LOOKS MALFORMED

Utahraptor: He's been beaten up, and he says he's hungry!  I don't understand!  How did this happen?  Why wasn't this done before?
T-Rex: I was simply curious!  I mean, I was just a little upset; I was just forin disappointment!

T-Rex: I was also a little stressed out about the fact that I wasn't hungry, that I had forgotten to eat some delicious snacks, and that had anything to do with it!
Utahraptor: Well how did you do that?  You seem to have a lot of opinions!
T-Rex: Right!  And all I can say is that I didn't have any expectations placed on me just yet!
