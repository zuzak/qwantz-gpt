T-Rex: I was asked for money on the street last night, and upon entry I was informed that the money was to be split equally equally equally equally equally as the result of all contributions of the same gender to the same party for the same money.

T-Rex: This, my friend, is QUANTUM EROTICA.

T-Rex: It is the familiar three-gender normative labour-dead market! And it's working! I've been called "Cash Woman, Big Hat, Employee of the Month" and I'm happy!
Dromiceiomimus: But you're also known as "Cash-Pilled Hottie".
T-Rex: HOW DID THAT WORK OUT?

Utahraptor: Wow, so now you're both working at being at opposite ends of the gender wage scale!
T-Rex: Oh! I see it now!

T-Rex: So um, since there's no gender equivalent of the rent I'm assigning to each of my causes, I'll divide the difference between the two. Then I get to work treating each of my causes like a separate person, but dividing it among them instead.
Utahraptor: That's easy, now!

T-Rex: Indeed!
T-Rex: As a consequence, the middle income tax cut for the wealthy will be for each of my causes exactly the same. No wonder we've been seeing each other all along!
T-Rex: It's the same...
