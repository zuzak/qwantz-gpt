T-Rex: Here are some jokes about horses. Why do horses like waterskiing?
GOD: I DON'T KNOW WHY T-REX
T-Res: Um... because they're horses!

GOD: T-REX THAT'S HORSE RACIST
T-Rex: What?!

T-Rex: How is it racist? If someone said "th-Rex, I'm a 'Horse T-Rex'" fan, that would be a "threesome" ... with horses!
Utahraptor: I'm not a dude who's goin' on horseback!

Utahraptor: Not in the "Get Dressed" sense, dude! Not in the "Get Insane" sense, anyway.
T-Rex: I'm just sayin'.
Utahraptor: Not in the "Get Informed" sense!

T-Rex: In the "Get Inventive" sense, anyway. Horses DON'T like to talk like humans do.
