T-Rex: I have the best joke for Dromiceiomimus. Man! Check it out:

T-Rex: "THE UNIVERSE'S GREATEST THING is a leftover from when they first made clothes out of goat skin. Then they sewed it all up."

T-Rex: "Then I made cat ears out of cow skin too, but you know what? I use goat skin now!"
Utahraptor: I use T-Rex's "worst" joke too!

Utahraptor: And mine is actually more "worst" than T-Rex's, actually. It's like - most things that can be done have already been done! The point is that without question, a joke is the best joke ever!
T-Rex: I'm so serious!
Utahraptor: I'm serious!

Utahraptor: If you've written a joke then you're a genius! You've also written a joke that's not so terrible, but still not so terrible.
T-Rex: Okay, I - um, I'm a brilliant party programmer?
T-Rex: AWESOME?!
