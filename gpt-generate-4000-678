T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!

T-Rex: I will consider it as a public service!

T-Rex: To begin: your house is too small and your car is slightly out of scale! And you put too many cookies on your plate!
T-Rex: Oh. And your portions are way out of scale with your growing eating disorder quotient!

Utahraptor: Your neighbours are all second-tier, you know, including yourself!
T-Rex: I do empathise!

Utahraptor: But I'm sure we'd all be better off if we had never met.
T-Rex: Yes! I do.
Utahraptor: That's why I'm SO WONDERING IF IN THE HISTORY OF THIS CONVERSATION I'M WELL, Dromiceiomimus.

God: T-REX WHAT IF I HAD ONE WEDDING LIFETIME THEN I SHOULD FEEL BAD about Eating Animals
T-Rex: I would honestly feel bad about that!!
God: OH MAN THAT'S LIKE THE ONLY TIME I'M EVER EVIL
