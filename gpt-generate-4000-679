T-Rex:  Hey, here's a fun thing for anyone who wants to talk about feelings:  HERE'S A GOOD PART.

T-Rex:  So I went to the gym!

T-Rex:  My flow was solid!
Utahraptor:  But you didn't even talk to the gym bouncer!

T-Rex:  I sounded like a regular person now!  I wasn't trying to get attention.  I was just at the gym.  Baaaaaa
Utahraptor:  I don't get it.  I'm at the gym.
T-Rex:  Hello?  I'm at the gym!

T-Rex:  Why are you yelling at me?  It's because I'm at the gym!
