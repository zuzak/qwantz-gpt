T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!

T-Rex: I will consider it as a public service!

T-Rex: To begin: your house is too small and your porch is slightly out of scale! And you put a premium on being awesome?
Dromiceiomimus: I think so! I'm sure I'll get some awesome tips if I get Batman to point at my roof and tell me where the stars and/or their crosswalks are.
T-Rex: Excellent! But I don't live at the top of the social chain.

Utahraptor: Social Skills, T-Rex! Hey, I'm seeing different people than I supposed!
T-Rex: I know! How'd you like a beat?

Utahraptor: Um - well, I'm happy to see you, as I was expecting nothing less than a say-no-harm policy?
T-Rex: Man! I feel terrible! I guess I just can't get past my snide comment.
Utahraptor: Oh well! At least I can't come at all by force!

Banner: On account of me being at the top of the food chain!
T-Rex: What are you talking about??
