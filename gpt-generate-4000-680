T-Rex:  Let's say all vegetables are suddenly super nutritious, so it doesn't matter which one you eat!  Like vegetables, super nutritious?

T-Rex:  Sure, check out my vegetables tip.

T-Rex:  Plus, if you have kids, you might want to learn some vegetables for each family.  Not bad!
Dromiceiomimus:  How would you tell if you've had kids?
T-Rex:  If you told them "her name is sexy and you should definitely try it", they'd reply "No, but I already know the answer!"

Utahraptor:  I bet you could take someplace you've never visited and put a picture of you and your little girl on your computer.
T-Rex:  Oh, that's androgyny!

T-Rex:  The parents will say "No, this image distracts from the fact that your child is definitely a woman."  Well, better try rogyny!
Utahraptor:  That's not a real doctor.
T-Rex:  Aha, but I already know all the symptoms of depression, so I might as well be able to say "She is not a fake woman who lies".

Narrator:  LATER:
T-Rex:  Somebody please tell my kids that they should eat fewerer things like pop leaves and grapes because THEY'RE healthier, INSTANTLY.
T-Rex:  YES
T-Rex:  YES, let's do that!
