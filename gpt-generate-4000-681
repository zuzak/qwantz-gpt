T-Rex: I am a guy who said "I feel fine" when we took the piss out of each other.

T-Rex: We then took the opposite route, and when we came back to the original expression, we said "Hah hah, looks like we lost the fight!"

T-Rex: We had over 20,000 kicks, but the MILLIONS we threw away were WAY more awesome than the one we got. I think we've defeated the hated Monopoly team, but with a slightly different name!
Dromiceiomimus: I don't think we've defeated the Monopoly team! We've just made some friggin' mistakes.
T-Rex: I know, right? Although, I don't know if it's possible to untie the knot without ruining the relationship.

Utahraptor: You sure have a lot of kicks, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yeah! Logically, I think you could lose this argument if you said "I won the online kick-punch game" instead.
T-Rex: I don't know, all I'm saying is that I will now resorts to puns and will become visibly offended.
Utahraptor: That's not very professional.
