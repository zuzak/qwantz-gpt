T-Rex: Hey, English! Why you gotta be so sexist?

Narrator: WHY YOU GOTTA BE SO SEXIST, ENGLISH

T-Rex: Why you gotta have a word like "old maid", chock full of negative connotations, and why shouldn't it be a verb, too?
Dromiceiomimus: "Old maid"?
T-Rex: WHY YOU SHOULD TRY

Utahraptor: "Pilissy" is actually a corruption of its predecessor, which is slang for slut.
T-Rex: *gasp*
Utahraptor: IT'S NOT SEXIST!

Utahraptor: "Pilissy" is pronounced "pee-po-se-al-ii-ee".
T-Rex: SHE'S EROTICA AND SHE'S NOT STEALING IT.
Utahraptor: She sucks.
T-Rex: She's a slut. SHE REFERS TO STISNING HIS EGGS, AND MAYBE SHE ALSO SOUNDS LIKE A SLUT.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: She looks totally underinformed about sex, man!
T-Rex: She's wearing nothing but a smooch, and a pornstar slip!
