T-Rex: My new book is a collection of fairy tales!

T-Rex: (It is, in fact, a collection of HER!)

T-Rex: In fact, I feel the book is a collection of mine!
T-Rex: (And if you are a man, you too will be fairy tales!)

T-Rex: In fact, I'm pretty sure MY book is a collection of mine!
T-Rex: (And if you are a woman, you too will be fair - but only if you join my story.)

Utahraptor: In all truth, I feel the book is just a collection of MY sexist ideas!
T-Rex: Sorry, I got you

Utahraptor: No, I don't think you get to decide who gets to be a woman in your story.  You make that choice yourself!
T-Rex: Sorry, I didn't mean to offend!  You too, my friend!
Utahraptor: No, you make your own rules for what's appropriate!
T-Rex: You don't have to be a heterosexual to be a woman in my book.  You don't even HAVE to be a heterosexual!

T-Rex: You can be a heterosexual and be good at what you do (society expects you to do it, yes)?
Utahraptor: Certainly!
T-Rex: Hah! How impossible it is to be a heterosexual now!
