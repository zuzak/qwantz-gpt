T-Rex: I've entered a poetry contest featuring me!

T-Rex: And don't freak out, I'm actually really excited!  I've been looking forward to writing poems for a while now!
T-Rex: What's that?  I'm really excited!

Utahraptor: So when you're down, are you up?
T-Rex: Man, I gotta'penetration!

Utahraptor: Poems are sort of depressing, aren't they?  I gotta'penetrate!
T-Rex: Dude, I couldn't swear I wrote a poem OLDER than I JUST PUNCHED IT.  That's CUTE!  I'll give you a number for that, okay?  It's OLDER than Ryan, right?

T-Rex: It'll be your poetry contest.  No, wait.  You can't all write poetry yourself.  I've got a friend who does that for you.
T-Rex: Fine!
T-Rex: I'll come in and give you a poem you can write!
