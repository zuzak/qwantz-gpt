T-Rex:  I am a guy who always announces what I'm thinking ahead of time by doing it in front of all of his friends.

T-Rex:  It's great!  I can do this!

T-Rex:  I'll say it for real: what if he didn't say that for me?  I'd say, "Oh, he's right!"  But if I'd say it for him, he'd say "Oh, he's wrong!" And I'd say "Oh, he's super dumb!"  And then I'd say "He sucks!"
Dromiceiomimus:  T-Rex, those are the two dominant sounds in my brain!  I'm your friendlier, tastier friend!
T-Rex:  HE'S JUST THE GRAVEYARD

Utahraptor:  It's true, T-Rex!  I make it so he won't listen to my comments anymore!
T-Rex:  FINE.  I'll just forget about it!

T-Rex:  His new friends will find out it's too late, because he'll just eat his words now!  And the rest of us will be immortalized in the afterlife BECOMING HIM!
Utahraptor:  You wish you wouldn't?  Maybe you should have a guy just like me on it!

T-Rex:  Oh yeah?  He's still here!  And I've changed him for the better!
T-Rex:  Maybe he'll write his own material and focus on new things instead of old problems!
