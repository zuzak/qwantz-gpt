T-Rex: "Now they show you how detergents take out bloodstains - a pretty violent image there! I think if you've got a T-shirt with a bloodstain all over it..."

T-Rex: "... maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem!"

T-Rex: "Maybe if you had more shirts, we could have more of them every day!"
Utahraptor: I find that hilarious, T-Rex!

Utahraptor: Why are you making me laugh, anyway? Is there a reason why we all seem to have shirts that say "Don't Be Sad, I'm Still With You"?
T-Rex: There totally is!  Did you know, Utahraptor that you can get your own tattoo by email?
Utahraptor: Has that ever worked?

T-Rex: I don't know, but it sure has!
T-Rex: "I love you / [the shirt says] [the words]]". [The words say] [the words]]?
