Narrator: THINGS THAT SOUND WAY MORE INTERESTING THAN THEY REALLY ARE
Narrator: a comic to read before you encounter these things

Narrator: "TROUBLE 4 UTAHRAPTOR"
T-Rex: UTAHRAPTOR! I didn't say we had problems!!
T-Rex: I've got one!

Narrator: "CHIMMERS"
T-Rex: A race has taken place, and two ladies are competing for the happy little cup!
Utahraptor: Wait, what happened?

Narrator: "LITTLE WOMEN"
T-Rex: AHHHHHHHHHH
Narrator: THE END

Narrator: "HORSES"
T-Rex: These things take time to get used to, and can take many forms, and are easily distracted by the cup!
Utahraptor: Ah, the ages of desolation and the dreughodenominus!

Narrator: "CUP SHAPED"
T-Rex: That is right, babies! I've changed my life and made it REALLY HAPPEN.
Utahraptor: Yep! That is a good course of action, and exhibits no sign of stopping.
T-Rex: Another course of action, and even those with regular womenizing may be unconscious!

Narrator: "FRIENDLY GOOD TIMES"
T-Rex: For a second there, I have felt bad about using "friendly good times" as a title!
T-Rex: Oh no!
T-Rex: I'd better fix that!
