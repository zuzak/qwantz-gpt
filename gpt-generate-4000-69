T-Rex: Being tall in a world designed for boy fashion isn't bad news for Batman!  His short frame and bulging manliness perfectly suit his chiseled frame!

T-Rex: P.S.: He also look like a chemically treated chemical castaway!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, would you like to go see a "Movie with Bruce Wayne"?
Dromiceiomimus: Sure!  It's a visual for the market, and a visual that only the visually impaired can see.
T-Rex: I see what you're trying to say, Dromiceomimus.  This is a commercial they can't use their official "Movie Site".

Utahraptor: I think they have a problem, T-Rex!
T-Rex: How?

Utahraptor: How do you mean by that?  It's kind of graphic?  Two people stand on the same page when it comes to this movie.
T-Rex: Hah!  I think they all agree that it's graphic.

T-Rex: I can see that making people's lives difficult, though!
