T-Rex: I have come up with a perfect way not to believe in ANYTHING ever again.  Evidentialism

T-Rex: A belief is justified only if there is sufficient evidence to support it!

T-Rex: I have come up with this way not because I love EVIDENCE, but because I just don't have the faith!  I feel as if I've bettered myself in the past, and it's all but certain that the days of faith are coming to an end.

Utahraptor: I feel as if I've built a wall between myself and the science that's governing our universe's rotation, between physics and chemistry and the science that's governing our stomping of the dog, and between the faith that surrounds me and the faith that's around the corner.

Utahraptor: With this in mind, let's jump down to my hiding place and begin asking questions!
Utahraptor: Okay!
Utahraptor: With that in mind, let's start a weekly secret society to find out who's doing what!

T-Rex: My hiding place is EVERYONE'S house!
T-Rex: Mulches!
