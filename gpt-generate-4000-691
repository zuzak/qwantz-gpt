T-Rex: I've entered a poetry contest!

T-Rex: I can't lose!

T-Rex: Right, Dromiceiomimus? I'm a good poet, right?
Dromiceiomimus: Sure! Although I've not heard much of your poetry!
T-Rex: I can assure you that my poetry is excellent, unlike our current department of state!

Utahraptor: So you want to enter?
T-Rex: You must have heard some bad jokes about me!

Utahraptor: Don't you think they're just afraid of being called racist?
T-Rex: Perhaps!

Utahraptor: But I don't want to hurt your feelings, T-Rex.
T-Rex: But I do want to hear your story! Please!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I cleaned the dishes in the kitchen.  "Good cooking, good dishes," said I.
T-Rex: "Did you hear that?  I found a way to live off of this empty dish that nobody else will ever want to eat!"
