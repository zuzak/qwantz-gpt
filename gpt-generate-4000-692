Narrator: CHICK PEAS IN CIDER
T-Rex: I like bacon! I like it when it's burnt, and I like it when it's charcuterie! I also like it when it's flavoured like ciabatta. I also like it when it's called the "kale of cannibale eyes".

T-Rex: And I'm like that too!

T-Rex: And I'm also voracious enough to give birth to entire chicken breasts at once! And I'll even use pesticides if I ever need it, because that's how crazy the chicken thing is.
T-Rex: I'm - I'm pretty crazy.

Utahraptor: What else can you do with an animal born with lungs that fill with donated body parts?

T-Rex: Try "warming on" chicken if you want, or try putting a human in it - it could be a good idea!
Utahraptor: Or - I could be willing to accept the consequences of your actions, and accept responsibility for them.

T-Rex: B-Get used to it!
