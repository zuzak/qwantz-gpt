Narrator: T-REX IN: "PRESENTISM"

T-Rex: Presentism is when you interpret the historical past with a view from the present!

T-Rex: Its danger is not just that it is often self-congratulatory, but also that judging historical figures by present-day moral standards is likely not a fruitful line of inquiry. What we see as questionable (say, sexism!) would have seemed completely routine to someone brought up in such a time, and we can't really blame historical figures, I think, for not questioning it!

Utahraptor: This seems awfully close to ethical relativism!
T-Rex: Huh?

Utahraptor: Well, aren't you saying we can't judge historical figures in a modern context, because they lived their lives during different times? But then what's the point of having our advanced modern ideals, if we can't apply them? I think we SHOULD be able to judge historical figures!

T-Rex: Anyway! In conclusion, presentism has good points and bad points and is not as interesting as I thought it was!
