T-Rex: There's all these really interesting and amazing people out there: people who know so many awesome things! Here are some of my favourites.

T-Rex: *ahem*

T-Rex: My favourite is an entire field of crops with only the most words remaining!

T-Rex: I mean, I love an entire field of crops, but I'm also interested in how words fit in with the rest of the crop? How did that taste?
Dromiceiomimus: How did that taste?
T-Rex: I like the taste of fruit

Utahraptor: That's kind of good, but I've got a problem: I don't want to have to eat that fruit anymore.
T-Rex: You're right! I'll just enjoy the taste of missing out on one of my favourite things in the entire world.

Narrator: THAT NIGHT:
T-Rex: Oh, are we still friends?
