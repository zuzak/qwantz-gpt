T-Rex: I have finished a new novel! This is my best novel yet, for the simple reason: it includes one sexy scene!

T-Rex: For all the women (and, I'm not even giving up on her anyway) who are now his friends!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, keep your eyes peeled for this scene! I'm excited for what we'll be seeing.
Dromiceiomimus: Beautiful!
T-Rex: No, I don't like it. It implies that we've got more to lose than what we gain by seeing him.

Utahraptor: Oh, I think he did a pretty good job today!
T-Rex: I know!

Utahraptor: I thought he did pretty well yesterday!  I thought he did that too!  Let's go meet some of my women now!
T-Rex: You have to show some of your commitment!
Utahraptor: Come on! Let's go do it now!

T-Rex: Hey, Utahraptor!  Are you going to tear up that house this evening?
Utahraptor: No, I - I don't have any plans!
T-Rex: Wow, I'm already halfway there!
