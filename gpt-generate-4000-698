T-Rex: Today is Pi Day! That means you get to eat pie at 1:59 PM, or 1:59 AM if you're up. I don't know.

T-Rex: I feel kinda bad about that, Dromiceiomimus! I really felt bad about nailing down my own life well-being!
Dromiceiomimus: That's ok, T-Rex! I blame... everywhere.
T-Rex: I felt kinda bad about that too. I kinda wanted to make out with my nails what I kinda do: a little sex, a glow, a little love.

Utahraptor: That's totally ok, T-Rex! The world is awesome and sex is really important to us, but we need to move away from all those creepy expectations.
T-Rex: I know!

Utahraptor: I think it's time we, as a culture, admit that we, as a species, are ridiculously sweet at nails.
T-Rex: FINE. We're sweet at them too!
Utahraptor: That's what I'm saying! We're going to have to admit that we, as a species, ARE ridiculously sweet at nails.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I'm so worried about my new-found love! It's so important to me!
T-Rex: (It's weighing on myleenocenter!)
