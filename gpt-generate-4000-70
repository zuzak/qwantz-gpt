T-Rex:  Robyn had a pleasant day of detective work.  Despite the heat of the sun, she found nothing that was amiss.

T-Rex:  Despite the smog of aging, she was convinced that there was hope.

T-Rex:  So she went on a trip to the future, looking for work!  The land of the dead didn't hold much of the remains of life, so she began archaeology.  Like so:
T-Rex:  based on the records of our own time.

Utahraptor:  So she digs up dead bodies and finds 'em like they were from a different generation!
T-Rex:  Exactly!

T-Rex:  So she's going back to the future and finding old bodies, but one that's like one of those retro hoverboards from the '50s, that look like they were made out of steel and plastic and stuff.  And she's picking at a body like it's some kind of retro controller, and the controller's transparent to the player, so when you touch it, it'll say "Classic SNES".
Utahraptor:  Ah.

T-Rex:  It's a shame she's so old, since she'll have to learn to play.  She'll have to learn to enjoy her time machine, and that, I don't have, any more influence!  She'll have died of something else... Cancer!!
Utahraptor:  I guess, just kidding.
T-Rex:  No, I guess...
T-Rex:  WHOAH
