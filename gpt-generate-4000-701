T-Rex: So light behaves like both a particle and a wave, right?  And I can hit dudes with particles.  Is it truly perfect, I ask ourselves?  What's the deal with it?

T-Rex: Is it all part of an AI?

T-Rex: No, it's not.  It kinda works like this.  If I want to run faster than light and enemies will pass me, I'll give an AI that's DRAMED (dropped by some moisture) a place in the sky, just so that it can feel like, oh crap, I'm wet.  And if it survives, it's given the ability to rain down even more rain, just so that I can hit things harder!  It's called "air hoseanda", you know?

Utahraptor: No, without an AI, this isn't a very good idea.  Air hoseanda aren't HUMAN.
T-Rex: Air hoseanda?

Utahraptor: That's - that's just ONE example.  I think we've got this one in ourselves.
T-Rex: And just like that: AI that thought "having fun" wasn't fun at all!
Utahraptor: Not mine!  Human hoseanda!
Utahraptor: We're almost done!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: What's this: I'm throwing my life on the line to GET ("make it big" or whatever it is?)!
T-Rex: Oh man, this is so much fun!
