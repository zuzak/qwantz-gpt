T-Rex: You know what the best part of every movie ever is?  Don't say "charmed" either, because I'll say it again:

T-Rex: Don't say that!

T-Rex: That was because it's such a great movie.  But as I said before, the BEST part of every movie is the narrative thrust upon us by the critical and commercial establishments.  The critical and commercial establishments, Dromiceiomimus!  YOU'RE THE MOST CONFUSED PERSON EVER IN TIME ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE WHEN THEY'RE HAVING HONESTLY.

Utahraptor: You're really the only one that can make that sound, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Really?

Utahraptor: Yep!  I was referring to the FICTIONAL commercial establishments.  You're heard to be saying, "Is that even possible?"
T-Rex: Is this what romance is all about?
Utahraptor: I guess!  I guess if they ever do decide to print your face, or to put you in a group for us to stay party to, that will be fine.

T-Rex: That is the best part of my role indeed, Utahraptor!  I can't wait to hear your reactions to the sequels!
Utahraptor: Are you waiting for me to call you on the phone?  Come on!
T-Rex: We're having dinner with the Utahraptor!
T-Rex: And he's having a hang-up call
