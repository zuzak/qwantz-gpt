T-Rex: Two men enter the ring - one man leaves!
God: THAT'S A LITTLE SEXIST DUDE
T-Rex: And THAT is fixed easily enough!

T-Rex: Two strangers kiss on each other!

T-Rex: If the first guy licks the lips of the second guy, then that's already a tongue, and that's - already a tongue.
Dromiceiomimus: The sex changes over time, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I think the answer is no, because now you can do either of two things:
Utahraptor: Neat!

Utahraptor: The sender of this kiss now knows he's the winner, so he's no longer allowed to make mistakes.
T-Rex: Yep! That's exactly what I meant!
Utahraptor: But that's stupid, because if he'd taken the time to learn about you and how you sound, I'd have forgotten about it in minutes.

Narrator: EARLIER:
T-Rex: woo! attention to my personal life issues! I try to make as much out of my life as I possibly can!
Person: Don't make me do that, T-Rex! I hate you and I'm not even certain what you're thinking!
T-Rex: This, my friends, is what you'll never get a single drop of!
