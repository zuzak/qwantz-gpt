T-Rex: You know what hasn't happened in space yet? Friggin' murder! Nobody's been murdered in space yet!

T-Rex: Guys! This means I still have a chance!

Dromiceiomimus: You want to be the first murderer in space?
T-Rex: No, man! That's a sucky way to go down in history. But as the first MURDEREE in space, going out as a floating corpse in Zero G: that's something! And it's totally easy. I've got nothing left to lose!

Utahraptor: Are you worried that by becoming a MURDEREE you risk being MURDERized,  Turk's got taken advantage of?
T-Rex: No, man! Nobody wants to be taken advantage of. Not me!

Utahraptor: I'm not worried. I've just got to learn to accept myself, and I've got nothing left to lose!
T-Rex: Good start!
Utahraptor: Ok! Come on, demonstrate for us t-rex.
T-Rex: Yoruba?
Utahraptor: Man, you don't even have any idea what Yorubaic music is.
Utahraptor: And you're not even covering your teeth!

T-Rex: I've just taught myself how to be a better astronaut! Come on. So, um...
T-Rex: But, uh, the MURDEREE got murdered by a better astronaut.
