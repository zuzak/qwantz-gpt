T-Rex: What did the universe, where everything is CHUM,SAVE ME T-REX

T-Rex: THE END

Narrator:<<p>THE THUNDER-LIZARDIANIAN FUTURE:>>
T-Rex: Ok, so the night started off with T-Rex and a sorcerer thinking she was everyone's best friend.  But then they discovered...

Utahraptor: And they either got superpowers or they didn't get one!
T-Rex: Hah!  Neither of!

Utahraptor: And they either get powers or don't get one.  And then someone else has powers, and they either get powers, or don't get any?  And then the sorcerer has a plan, and she gives in to her plans and runs away!  I GOT IT.
T-Rex: Oh, I almost forgot it.  It's so sad!

Narrator:<<p>THE CREAM OF TOMATOES:>>
T-Rex: I've got my own life ahead of me, and I'm learning!
Utahraptor: I've got my own secrets.
T-Rex: More secrets!
T-Rex: The more secrets, the more I feel like I'm watching a David versus Goliath battle!  The more I feel like I'm watching, the more I feel like I'm watching, the MORE I feel like I'm watching, and the MORE I FEEL, the more I feel I'm FEEL, THE MORE I FEEL, THE MORE I KNOW...

T-Rex: THE DAY I FINERALLY MEET a GOLF!
T-Rex: Oh my God!
T-Rex: That would be a T-Rex story!
