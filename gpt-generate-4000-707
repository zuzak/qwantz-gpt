T-Rex: I have gone too far "down the rabbit hole" and am reduced to being sure only of my own thoughts, and even then only of MY own FREE will. To truly understand the world, you have to step on at least one life, and then you've got to be willing and able to make decisions.

T-Rex: You could be a complete brain, with no self-awareness!

T-Rex: That's why it's so easy to become a crazy dude! You just have to have an irrational fear of heights, and then you're a crazy guy. You have to consciously decide what you want to do with your life, and then, when you're old, you kill that fear.
Dromiceiomimus: By living a dream, you're no longer sure if you're dreaming at all!
T-Rex: That's the magic of lucid dreaming: you wake up in a fanciful past, when you were all cells and thoughts were literally endless red-state LEDs. And you're free to imagine whatever you want!

Utahraptor: The dream can also happen while you're sleeping!
T-Rex: You know it!!

T-Rex: If I dream of something, I know that that's what that thing is. But if I don't, I know that that's not me! That's a fanciful idea. I have no idea what I'm dreaming about.
Utahraptor: Okay.
T-Rex: Well, I don't!

Narrator: EARLIER:
T-Rex: What a delicious meal it is, my friends!
