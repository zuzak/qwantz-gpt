T-Rex: I am a guy who gets up early, marvels myself, and then goes to bed in progress.

T-Rex: Figured I'd be interesting!

T-Rex: If there's one thing I've got, it's eye contact!
Dromiceiomimus: Why do you think people get all their information from face to eye?
T-Rex: Well, DROMICEIOMIMUS, I think that is a good point.

Utahraptor: Yeah, but I think face is just some subset of society, and we need to talk to people on the same level.
T-Rex: Well, I don't know - maybe! But I don't want to brag too much, Utahraptor. I'm only the tiniest bit preparing for sex thing.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: man, this sounds really awesome!
T-Rex: I GUESS I could do anything!
