T-Rex: You know what they say: you can't take it with you!  But you can take it with you!  And I won't say another word you can't accept.

T-Rex: Oh, what a great name!

T-Rex: And THAT'S great, Dromiceiomimus!  I can accept that I'm a ghost, accept that I've got powers, accept that I can summon thousands of pounds of food, drinks, and other junk that I don't really need, and that the pounds are going towards the care and treatment of Ghosts that have opened the door to many a home!
Dromiceiomimus: Well if you're going to call them "Babies and Dads"!  That's already out of control!
T-Rex:  No minds had ever been so excited!!

Utahraptor: Here's one you can't resist: "COFFEE ADDICTION".
T-Rex: What?  No minds!

Utahraptor: Yeah, I can hear you through the grapefruit trees of Acadia, eating as much as you want, only now feeling like you've somehow avoided meeting with someone so terrible.  "Disgusting!" they say, and then they throw their beer can down behind you, striking the can with their clubs.  Oh, and they try to avoid eye contact, but they'rewolves don't want to talk shit through their bodies.

T-Rex: What's the official name of this mysterious form of life, though?
Utahraptor: "Carpetwolf".
T-Rex: Burnous, my friend!
