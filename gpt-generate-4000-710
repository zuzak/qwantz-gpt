T-Rex: I have received complaints. Apparently I can be difficult to follow.  I thought I'd perfected this joke for...

T-Rex: ...a REVELATION.

T-Rex: I confess that I have been a difficult choice!  I was never a very good choice, myself.  I was always a great choice, a terrible choice, a friend of Dromiceiomimus who is a BAD choice, and YOU, dear friend, I hate to be the one to say.
T-Rex: You know what?  I'm going home okay?

Utahraptor: Goodbye, T-Rex!  I'm returning to New York.
T-Rex: I'm glad you invited me, Utahraptor.

Narrator: LATER: T-REX MISSES THE SAME THING.
T-Rex: I miss the things we ate together!
