T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!

T-Rex: I will consider it as a public service!

T-Rex: To begin: your house is too small and your porch is slightly out of scale! And you! Your cart is not moving! And your car is not moving!
T-Rex: Today is a good day for having a series of boring conversations about those cars.

Narrator: ONE WORD:
T-Rex: car!
Utahraptor: What's a car?

T-Rex: It is a cumbersome, time-consuming and expensive way to express appreciation.
Utahraptor: What about those broken pianos you played at the restaurant you ate?
T-Rex: They were instruments that nobody is still using today!

Narrator: ONE WORD:
T-Rex: don't i know how you missed this restaurant but i love you and i love eating your food and then talking about you dromiceiomimus
