T-Rex:  I want to write something that'll make people see the world through fresh eyes!  Something that'll make me say "GOD, T-REX, ARE YOU EVEN GIANT" and then, I'll give you a hug and say "GOD, ACTUALLY I THOUGHT YOU were a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny dinosaur."

T-Rex:  &#8211;Thank god I totally ate a tiger! &#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;
Utahraptor:  That was WAY better!
T-Rex:  Exactly!

T-Rex:  My muse is this endless parade of tiny, adorable animals, and I recommend everyone to everyone who travels with her visit only with some small corset.
Utahraptor:  My friend, I'm sorry to interrupt, but we've got to take you to the mall!  It's... IT'S AWFUL THERE.

God:  IT'S MALLOWED
T-Rex:  Oh my god, get to know the people who aren't in charge here!  THERE'S RUDOLPH.  Sally Struthers, M.D.  was found dead with a giant toothbrush.  That's the end of Struthers!  That's Struthers Jr.
