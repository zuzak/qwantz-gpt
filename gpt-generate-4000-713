T-Rex:  Hello!  I have some advice for getting over here!  Here's what I've been saying:

T-Rex:  No, wait.  Don't treat me like a baby!

T-Rex:  Here's what I've been saying:
T-Rex:  No, wait.  Don't treat me like a baby!

T-Rex:  No, wait.  Don't treat me like a broken record!
Utahraptor:  No, wait.  Don't treat me like a BABY RECORD.

Utahraptor:  Wait.  Don't treat me like a WONDERFUL OCCAM'T MONSTER that I never grew up to be a giant dinosaur-hug!  Here's some advice for that that I'll never miss.

Narrator: A FEW MONTHS LATER:
T-Rex:  I love having crazy adventures and giant monocleols!
Utahraptor:  Me too!
T-Rex:  Great!
