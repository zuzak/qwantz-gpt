T-Rex: History is pretty boring, right? Sure. A bunch of stuff that happened to dead people who didn't even know what a computer was. Woo hoo.
T-Rex: But what if I told you -

T-Rex: ...THREE CENTURIES OF HISTORY IS LIES??

T-Rex: You wanna know more about history now, huh? Yeah you do. "I sure hope the lie centuries aren't any of the good ones," you're saying. I get it!
T-Rex: SO HERE'S THE IDEA: in the year 614 someone - or someONES - alter the calendar ahead by 297 years, skipping right to the year 911. And records of this jump are lost, because it's the middle ages! And that explains why not many things happened in this SUPER BORING time period!

Utahraptor: This is all pretty implausible, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I hadn't thought of this!

Utahraptor: It's not like you could read history back into alternate timelines! You'd have to be lucky. "Maybe 614 didn't really exist at the time, and all that happened is INFINITY we're willing to accept that he was a guy who made mistakes," you'd say. "And now we all know he's a big jerk who makes bad decisions."

T-Rex: I'M AFRAID I'M SO KIDDING
T-Rex: I definitely need to make some changes in my life to make it more interesting and less depressing, but I promise if I change anything I'll do it first!
Narrator: T-REX MISSES EVERYTHING THAT COULD ACHIEVEMENT IN:
T-Rex: Just found out my pornwatching happened to be doing exactly what I wanted it to!
