T-Rex: I am going to write a story and it will be something BRAND NEW. It will be the most staggeringly original story ever. It will be the story of Spider-Man, the man of steel, stepping on a water feature and landing in a strange part of space!

T-Rex: And then, after that, the water feature!

T-Rex: And then Spider-Man lands in some pretty unfamiliar territory!
T-Rex: But then he discovers a way to make the feature "land" (a.k.a. the Earth!), and he's not a stupid ol' dude. He's a smart, smart, smart dinosaur.
T-Rex: SO LUCKY THAT T-REX WOULD TELL.

Utahraptor: And then he has to eat?
T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: And then he has to eat a bunch of vegetables, and then he's not a very good friend, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, you should have put "adventures" in your second sentence. "T-Rex saves himself trouble."
T-Rex: Yes I do!!

T-Rex: Some of my best friends are T-Rex and Utahraptor, but even I can't help but want to be friends with each other.  Is that a real sentence?  Is it something that's made only vaguely clear by the time you are finished?
Utahraptor:  I am still happy with my friendships
