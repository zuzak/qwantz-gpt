T-Rex: Man, who is the dude who dropped his wallet in the toilet last night? WAS IT ME?  It's possible to be a wimp out in one of the greatest collections of financial records in the world.

T-Rex: OR it could be a savvy bankster, living off her accumulated losses over the course of a single night!!

Dromiceiomimus: Why do we do this, T-Rex? Did you know that, once a friend has a wallet, they're not really legally married?
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I don't think you're legally married in the first place. That's why I never got in touch with you.
Dromiceiomimus: Are you worried that if you get married, your wallet will be part of your security?

Narrator: A FEW YEARS LATER:
T-Rex: Oh wow, that wallet was all my responsibility but it turned out that it was in fact my freedom.
Utahraptor: I'm concerned you might be snapped back to your old age, get married and swashbuckle.

T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: It turns out that, for the purposes of today's wedding, I was a guest at the wedding of my own free will.  It's a hella sweet wedding!
Utahraptor: I get the sense you empathize with some of the issues here.
T-Rex: I guess!

Utahraptor: Or perhaps if you ARE married you want to make all the money, the same way you want to hook up with someone and make them pay for it!
T-Rex: That's what I'm saying!
