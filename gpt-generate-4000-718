T-Rex: Hey, here's a fun thing for anyone who wants to share: you can now download song lyrics into your own computer!

T-Rex: And if you have trouble processing the lyrics, just make them up again, and don't tell everyone you're doing it for copyright reasons!

T-Rex: This way, there's no place for copyright jokes in my kitchen!
Dromiceiomimus: I think you're not using the song as a parody, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I use it as a copyright joke, Dromiceiomimus! All my jokes are about how great is it that nobody can really say what I think is my favorite dance.

Utahraptor: Does it make you feel better that you can do this?
T-Rex: It really does.

T-Rex: It really makes me feel good, because I say this as someone who loves music, but hates those who keep trying. I say that as someone who loves being big into my own body AND soul, but still big into the idea of a world where nobody can say what I think is my favorite DATE for work, but who wants to be that guy who always gets a new set of ears!
Utahraptor: ...

T-Rex: I - I do!
T-Rex: ...Okay, I do!
