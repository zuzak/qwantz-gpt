T-Rex: I am a guy who said "I don't want to be a police officer, okay?" to himself. I said it out loud.
T-Rex: It was probably on the advice of hand-written notes.

T-Rex: It was probably on the advice of overambitious teens. I don't know but it did take me a while.

T-Rex: It was probably more than a decade of accumulated experience, but I did it anyway because I just want to be a police officer. I just want to be an officer who keeps getting frisked, and sometimes, I suspect, goes overboard and causes more harm than good.
T-Rex: Frisking!
T-Rex: It's always a threat if I see you frisking, okay?

Utahraptor: I think you're too old and cachet goodgering, T-Rex!
T-Rex: That's okay, but I don't want to be that guy who goes overboard and causes more harm than good.

Utahraptor: Frisking is for a younger gentleman, remember?
T-Rex: Of course. You're a kid, and you don't want to be that guy who goes too far.
Utahraptor: But you want to be the guy who never gets frisked.
T-Rex: That's okay, though!

T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for asking profound philosophical questions!
T-Rex: *gasp*
T-Rex: I have said enough!
