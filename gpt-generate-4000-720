T-Rex: Are you interested in buying in to a new friendship? If yes, you are ALREADY doing so.

T-Rex: WELL!  Am I doing the right thing by buying in to a friendship?!  How did I even do that?

T-Rex: I did this before, Dromiceiomimus!  I did this while I was sitting and decided to add $5 into the first $1.  It was a good move.
Dromiceiomimus: Then why did you do this though? Were you looking to have a good time?
T-Rex: No, I was looking to have a good time AND be alone.
Dromiceiomimus: Oh no, now you're looking to have a good time AND be alone.  Well, having a good time could be good too!

T-Rex: $5 is already $5 worth of memories!
Utahraptor: What are you doing?

T-Rex: Well, have you looked at the value of your time?
Utahraptor: Oh, I'm sorry, T-Rex! I think you should-
T-Rex: I'm sorry too

T-Rex: Don't try to make me disappear, Utahraptor! I know you're struggling and I know you're trying to focus on your problems, but don't try to make me disappear either. I know you're trying.  Don't try to make me feel better?
Utahraptor: I don't know how you ever explain your $5.
T-Rex: I lost it anyway!
