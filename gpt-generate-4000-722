T-Rex: Oh crap oh crap I think I have a problem!  A problem that CANNOT be cured, that is, solved by drugs!

T-Rex: I think I might be the only one with this problem!  Why don't we start with dieting?
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe you could just get in shape and eat less food, and look good!
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: Then I eat less and do the opposite!  I eatacy, and then I diet and eat!
Utahraptor: Well, there's the problem of women who do diet, and that's even more virulently racist!

Utahraptor: The women in question didn't eat enough to make a fatass egg, and then they made a stinky, smelly, disgusting pile.  They're the only ones!  Don't they know it?
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I can't believe you just called me up!
Utahraptor: They're the ones!

T-Rex: They're the only ones.  They're the ones who don't eat enough to be racist.
Utahraptor: They're the one.
T-Rex: They don't eat enough to believe that Christmas is a real world where people sometimes make fun of each other, but which is really just an expression on the part of me to spit in their faces.
