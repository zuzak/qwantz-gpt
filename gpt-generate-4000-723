T-Rex: What day of the week is it?  IT'S NOT IMPORTANT, because all that matters is that today it's time for another...

T-Rex: SECRET of the MEDICAL PROFESSION!

T-Rex: Doctors have a difficult job: you come in with symptoms and you expect a diagnosis.  And sometimes that's really hard!  Hate to break it to you, Chuckles, but there's always the chance it's all in your head.
Dromiceiomimus: There's also the chance your symptoms represent a new and terrible disease unknown to medical science!
T-Rex: And in both these cases a doctor may feel pressured to come up with a reassuring label!

Utahraptor: So what do they do?
T-Rex: They MAKE IT UP!

T-Rex: It's called a wastebasket diagnosis: a disease with symptoms so broad as to be effectively meaningless.  But it can do real good!  Having a named disease can lower patient anxiety and even help alleviate symptoms!
Utahraptor: Diagnosis as therapy?
T-Rex: Exactly!  It's like the placebo effect!

T-Rex: ...in that now that we know about it, IT CAN NEVER HELP US AGAIN
T-Rex: OH WAIT, I'M GOING ON A DATE
