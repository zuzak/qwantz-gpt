Narrator: FRUSTRATION COMICS II
T-Rex: I'm frustrated again!
Utahraptor: Me too!

Utahraptor: I'm frustrated at my bank because they're all a bunch of sucker chumps! What are you frustrated at?
T-Rex: I'm frustrated at my apparent inability to have a serious conversation about feelings without making jokes about how ridiculous all feelings are ever!

T-Rex: Not that frustrated, though. I wrote "pussy" on a piece of paper and said "I really really want to hear about your feelings."
T-Rex: I guess I should get away from it.
