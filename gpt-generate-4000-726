T-Rex:  In my new video game, you control a woman named "Mary Oh". She's smart and beautiful, and she's also pretty great at writing video games.

T-Rex:  But some of her friends are STUPID, and some of them are INTERESTING in the sweet sex.

T-Rex:  So Mary Oh stops being a sweet friend and becomes a lurk in the night, whereupon she destroys her enemies and becomes a sex worker for the Devil!
Dromiceiomimus:  And then the Devil gets kinda sad?
T-Rex:  No, actually.  That's not at all what she meant.  She realized that if she was evil, then no matter what she did, she'd never be good at anything.

Utahraptor:  And she becomes a sex worker for the Devil?
T-Rex:  Oh!  That sounds really sad!

T-Rex:  And then she becomes a sex worker for the Devil?  Oh MY GOD, THAT'S CRAZY!  I'm going to write a story where the Pope gets involved and writes "Forsooth!!!"
Utahraptor:  And then the scene breaks when the Pope writes "And also!"
T-Rex:  "Also, I didn't write that!"

T-Rex:  "I should probably write... 'Here's How'!"
T-Rex:  The scene was so good I figured it was actually inspirational for me to do even MORE things!
