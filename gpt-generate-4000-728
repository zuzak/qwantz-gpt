T-Rex:  Hello there!  I am interested in sexing up your partner!  I am especially into holes!

Narrator:  HITLER'S HOUSE

T-Rex:  The killer's house!

T-Rex:  There were a few pillow-times at the party, but you know what they are!  I will tell you all about it later.
T-Rex:  It was a good night!
T-Rex:  THE END!

Utahraptor:  Hey, T-Rex, did you see my hot smushie today?
T-Rex:  I did, yes!

Utahraptor:  Wow, thanks!  I didn't think you'd be interested in smushies.
T-Rex:  I did, in fact, but it was BECAUSE I was hyping it!  You know what I'm talking about?
Utahraptor:  It's!  It's absolutely fantastic!

Narrator:  THE END
