T-Rex: I have received complaints. Apparently I can be difficult to follow, and sometimes people get confused.

T-Rex: I hope that will not be the case today, with...

T-Rex: DINOSAURS!

Dromiceiomimus: What is it, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I have nothing to declare! I'm actually happy with my day, despite the fact that it's been a while.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm not! You must not have anything to declare.

Utahraptor: I declare, of course! No-one can claim anything for themselves!

Utahraptor: Well, you do, because we've all entered a stage where relationships are no longer viable. You can't just discard a relationship and say you're done with it.
T-Rex: Man, what awful people!
Utahraptor: I thought this stage was ending, before this jerk showed up!

T-Rex: As I observe, it is precisely this jerk!
Utahraptor: How do you know? I've told you all about the stupid little toast I made to you recently.
T-Rex: Not allowed!
