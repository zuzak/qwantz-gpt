T-Rex: You know what'd be great?  A restaurant that serves gourmet versions of classic comfort foods, like burgers and fish and chips!
God: THAT'S PLAGIARIZED

T-Rex: And you have all these great details about the restaurant, all these fantastic details about the burgers and burgers and finally a picture of your child eating the fish and chips, and THEN, a picture of your child on the next page, with your baby eating the fish and chips, and THEN, a picture of your child on the next page, with the baby's parents, and THEN, a picture of your child all over the place!
T-Rex: That's one I'll make SO MUCH, Utahraptor. I'll make it a Thing That Everyone Can Like!  Except if They Actually Do.

Utahraptor: So when people come to your restaurant, you want to make them feel good things?
T-Rex: Of course!

T-Rex: Why don't you do this already?  Tell them your restaurant is great, and they'll want to order one.  I can WORK WITH THAT.
Utahraptor: Okay, but you'd have to show them your fish and chips!
T-Rex: What?  I can't!  That's not what I'm asking.

Narrator: THE NEXT DAY:
T-Rex: Nice work, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: No thank you, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's okay, I guess.  It's actually pretty hard to get great at work.
Utahraptor: What?
T-Rex: What?
Utahraptor: Yeah, I got good at it.
