T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!

T-Rex: I will consider it as a public service!

T-Rex: To begin: your house is too small and your car is slightly out of scale! And you! Your colouring is improbable!
Dromiceiomimus: You're both pointing out failures, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I am!

T-Rex: My house has only the most superficial of wrinkles, Dromiceiomimus.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm sorry, T-Rex, but this is all about as much as I can say for sure.

Utahraptor: Your house, T-Rex, is so small that your car could fit inside you!
T-Rex: That's true!

Utahraptor: Your car is small enough that it could fit inside you!
T-Rex: That's ridiculous! Smaller cars are permitted on account of security, Utahraptor.

Utahraptor: I'm just pointing out the compromises you make when interacting with your friends!
T-Rex: Okay, you've got me!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Yours is a fictional character!  I'm just musing through my thoughts right now!
