T-Rex: What if I worked productively and creatively towards achieving my goals today?

T-Rex: That is the premise of "Status"!

I REQUIRE YOU TO EAT HOT DICE.

I DESIGN A DOOPAGE.

I ACCEPT I MAY BE A HEDONISM WHEN I FLIP FIVE FOLLOWING ME AROUND
T-Rex: I'm just not feeling that lovey-dovey anymore, Dromiceiomimus.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm glad we're friends, T-Rex!
T-Rex: SO KIDDING.

IT WAS A BIT OF A DOUBLE JOKE.
Utahraptor: I'm glad we're friends!
T-Rex: *gasp*

Utahraptor: I'm glad we're friends too: three email addresses that we've got BOTH comfortable friendships named after us. I'd love to get inside their brains!
T-Rex: Let's do it, Utahraptor! Let's do it RIGHT NOW! Let's do it RIGHT NOW. I'm done for!

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: I've had tons of awesome adventures
