T-Rex: I'm not hotted out by women who demand instant gratification from me!

T-Rex: I'm just glad I'm not with Kellogg's or McDonald's!

Dromiceiomimus: I agree, T-Rex, but I'm relieved you're not pregnant with your baby.
T-Rex: Oh, I am totally. I'm enamoured with eating McDonald's foodstuff. I think it's pretty great.
I think about the babies I see every day: da da da da da da da da da

Utahraptor: I think I'd better get my own!
T-Rex: What?

Utahraptor: Yeah, I think you're not supposed to leave your own little world in front of a child.
T-Rex: I don't see why you're trying! I can see me looking around and thinking "what the heck, this is gross" and feeling a little offended.
Utahraptor: I'm not sure if this is good for children!

T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: The thought of leaving a beautiful world for a child so terrible has been a powerful thought for many...
