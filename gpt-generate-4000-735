T-Rex: Oh crap! Everybody died!

T-Rex: I should've been out of here sooner!

T-Rex: Back to my friends! When some kid says "You stink like a little T-Rex", I should say "No way, dude!"
Dromiceiomimus: Why do you think that's a bad thing?
T-Rex: Because it's not bad, Dromiceiomimus. I said it out loud!

Utahraptor: Maybe you should've said it earlier!
T-Rex: I already know how to do that!

T-Rex: And I totally did when I was 12! But then I started hearing it from my mother, and suddenly I could hear it from my grandmother, and suddenly I could live in a world of its own!
Utahraptor: Okay, I agree, but sometimes children's parents share it!
T-Rex: You'd be able to hear it clearly, nobody?

T-Rex: It's not the fault of my parents! IT'S HOW I FEEL! I'm not saying anything REMORSEFUL that I didn't already know it.
T-Rex: Anyway, I've decided against gonna get a tattoo! It violates the "ain't got no plans" rule!
