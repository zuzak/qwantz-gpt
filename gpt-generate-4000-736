T-Rex: Am I perhaps too comfortable knowing that I'm not a true Star Trek: The Next Generation?

T-Rex: Perhaps, at the very least!

T-Rex: It is a theory, I think, that some degree of causality is responsible. Would you say "Awareness is blissful!"?
Dromiceiomimus: I would not, T-Rex!
T-Rex: You and I don't get along, and we haven't seen each other in a long while.

Utahraptor: I think you'd be better off if youitudes were more like Starfleet Headquarters!
T-Rex: The two Starfleet officers I see as the cause of all this activity.

Utahraptor: Uh, both of you are really adorable!
T-Rex: Oh, you're really all over the blue and white!
Utahraptor: I love them both equally!

T-Rex: I'm sure I'll have lots to say on the blue and white, but for now, all I really want to say is this:
T-Rex: I'm so glad I was right!
