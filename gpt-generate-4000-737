T-Rex:  You guys!

T-Rex:  Let's assume the universe is deterministic!!

T-Rex:  And if that's true we're no more responsible for our actions than a computer is for executing code.  We have BEESS over 200 billion actions we could possibly take in the universe, covering a full-sized universe of 0.3 light years across!  That's about .0001 lightthrees!  I'm going to say, "Okay, this is a pretty good guess, but you should be."

Utahraptor:  What are you guys talking about?  A billion actions?
T-Rex:  NICE.

T-Rex:  I'm BASICALLY talking about the entire universe being up to these bets!  Including yourself in the joke.
Utahraptor:  That's a lot of bets for one dude, huh?
T-Rex:  Of course!  I'm not saying that in a "thanks to the t-ree for the sperm" way.  That would be inappropriate.

T-Rex:  Hmm... that surprised some of you, Utahraptor.  I thought you were, like, taking my word for it?
Utahraptor:  Nope!  Only weird.  You have to stick with your guns on Twitter.
T-Rex:  Anyway!  I'm still the same T-Rex guy, by the way!
