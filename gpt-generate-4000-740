T-Rex: You know what they say: you can't take it with you!  You can't get rid of it!  And you try!  And it works!  You can kill it with your dagger or you can make a paste by grinding the flesh into a long ball.  The results are ball(s) with the words on them coming out the wrong color.

T-Rex: Pfft, that's totally true.  And I think that probably got you some things, Dromiceiomimus.  You know what they say: you can't take things with you!  You can't clean them or they'll stick to your promises and you'll never get around to making them more FALSE?
Dromiceiomimus: Again, that's true.
T-Rex: TRUE.  And you can't even clean a toilet that big!

Utahraptor: Man, that just makes my breath seem a lot like nail polish
T-Rex: I know!  I know!  I'm going to learn more about this matter later.

T-Rex: Today I am going to go get my own nail polish.
Utahraptor: It won't last forever!
T-Rex: It will, sadly, and we'll see what the fallout is after I leave.  I only hope it's with nail polish.

Narrator: THAT NIGHT...
T-Rex: I KNOW IT WAS A STOLEN DAY
