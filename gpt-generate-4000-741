T-Rex: You know in those stories where there's this immortal guy and they're like "this is it! I have discovered a new realm! I am an immortal!" and then they have some boring stories where they're like "we can't tell this story because we're killed by a bunch of flies, I am an alive, smiling dude"!

T-Rex: And then they have like a save-the-beet action-adventure story where they're like "let's replay the above two stories! This time, I'm just a guy who punches a bunch of guys."

Utahraptor: And they have like a shoot-em-fight story where you're Joe Grater, which is a genre that involves people dying in boss fights!
T-Rex: And!

T-Rex: And then they have a superhero storytelling story where they're like "let's fight giant robots with giant robots SO HARD that the giant robot gets saved!"
Utahraptor: It's a restrained but delicious revenge story!
T-Rex: It's delicious!

God: T-REX YOU'VE DONE WRITING FOR LINE 1.2 OF THEIR COMIC!
T-Rex: And by that I mean, of course, should you're not the guy who punches the giant robot, because:
God: line breaks God
God: I'M NOT the guy who punches the giant robot
!
T-Rex: Hah hah hah! It's okay!
