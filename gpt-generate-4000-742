T-Rex: Hey there teens now!  You know what teens are?

T-Rex: Wooo!

T-Rex: Are you interested in being a teen?
T-Rex: Because if not then I guess you've just spent SOME OF YOUR WET period!
T-Rex: HAH HAH HAH.

Utahraptor: Something's been left missing from this teen, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Was?

Utahraptor: Yes.  Was there something that stood out in you that stood out even though everyone you talked to had already died?
T-Rex: Something simple - like sitting still and letting the air in cool room cool down?

T-Rex: Something pretty great, you know?  Something that'll keep you out of my cold storage units, pressed to my window-m away from all but the most interesting parts of my body!
Utahraptor: Something that'll make you want to kill me, if that's possible.
T-Rex: A lifetime of killing, my friend!  And an ending that makes me say, "That concludes my post-apocalyptic vision for the future"!

Narrator: ENDING: MEANWHILE, IN THE DARK FORCE:
T-Rex: Writing on a computer, yes!
T-Rex: In my dystopian vision, we learn that technology has become entrenched in society and the only option left is to run around and grab the technology!
