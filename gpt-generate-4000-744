T-Rex: Today I believe we can all agree that the world is moving in the right direction!

T-Rex: It sure is!

T-Rex: And I certainly do believe WE can all agree that things are getting better. Specifically, I believe things are getting BETTER for everyone, positively and otherwise.
Dromiceiomimus: And do you believe things are getting BETTER for EVERYONE, at least for the poor ones?
T-Rex: No, for sure!

T-Rex: I saw perfect time yesterday in Brussels, Belgium! No changing, just old and standard "here's some fries, I want some fries, they're great" signs!
Utahraptor: What does that have to do with burgers and fries?

Utahraptor: Well, it does have to do with them not being so bad to the last two burgers we ate.
T-Rex: Uh! And neither of those burgers were good to ME.
Utahraptor: Ha ha! What a bunch of UNQUOTED, UNQUOTED, UNQUOTED crap.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I actually had a really good idea! I'm glad I invented it.
