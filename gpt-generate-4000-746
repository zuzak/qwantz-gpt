T-Rex: I have the ultimate CONVERSATION FILLER. Now no longer will there be awkward pauses in my conversations! Oh yes. No longer.

T-Rex: Because whenever I don't know what to say, I'll just exclaim "Sounds like a good date!"

T-Rex: An excellent idea! Therefore, this moment has been condensed down to "Conversation FILLER"!
Dromiceiomimus: So you're going for recordbook book for this moment?
T-Rex: Yes! I will be the first to say "Yes!"!

Utahraptor: So you're going for the NOW?
T-Rex: Hopefully! I just thought it was something to do!

Utahraptor: Well, that's good, as always. I think this conversation is one long record of few moments.
T-Rex: I'll record some more for you, Utahraptor! I'll be glad to hear about your new creation.

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: I just found out that you took a vow of perpetual youth. Now that you know me, I can tell you about your awesome friend!
Utahraptor: That's nice, I guess.
T-Rex: Nevermind.
