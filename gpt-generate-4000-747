Narrator: THE ETYPICAL END OF RELATIONSHIPS
Narrator: A COMIC BASED ON A TRUE STORY!

T-Rex: And the problem with relationships is that they involve more than one person at once! One person trusting the other (this is called "adversarialpresence"), and it can be hard to scale!

T-Rex: Imagine a world where people knew each other for a long time, but where they met for only a short time!

T-Rex: We might convene to decide who gets to spend their time with us, but we'd still know each other from the other people who did SOMEDAY. In this world, we'd always have the same old friends: wives and girlfriends!
Dromiceiomimus: It would be nice!
T-Rex: I know! It would be nice!

Utahraptor: Are you really imagining this?
T-Rex: It will be nice!

Utahraptor: Nice!
Utahraptor: I can't wait for your wedding!
T-Rex: I can't wait!

Narrator: THE END
