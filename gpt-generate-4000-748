T-Rex: You know what's awesome? When there's a story on the news, and then they go to people "on the street" for their reactions to the story!

T-Rex: Wait, did I say "awesome"?! I meant "HOLY COW< SO TERRIBLE!"

T-Rex: They're stopping the flow of information to literally ask RANDOM STRANGERS what they think. The only way it'd be acceptable is if they prefaced these stupid segments with "and now, here's what some strange folks on their way to do something better had to say!" but THEY NEVER DO.

Utahraptor: It's not that bad, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's SO BAD.

Utahraptor: It's not even scientific, you know? You'd have to imagine the situation as a nuclear bomb is placed in reverse, and then you wait for the news to change.
T-Rex: Holy crap, that would be SO FANTASTIC. I'm so tired of waiting!

Narrator: AMAZINGLY, T-REX WINS!
