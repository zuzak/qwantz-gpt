T-Rex: I am not a dude who uses Twitter like a social network would've liked me.  I use it as a social network for swear words, raps that end with "deranged" or "damn ass", etc.

T-Rex: Not a swear word!

T-Rex: Not a REAL swear word.  It's like - it's this group of swear words I haven't considered entirely.  But then I think, "Whoah, so much for the 80-year tradition of 'deranged swear words'."
T-Rex: But then I think, "How come everyone's so into rock stars and shouting and making swear words, AND I could use a swear word?  Is there a reason why all the rock stars and shouting people are now women?  I will never know."

Utahraptor: It's cool to think that's the case!
T-Rex: It's true!

T-Rex: It's more than "women are welcome in the rock star section only".  It's like, there's a women in the rock star section RIGHT NOW, and we're all "giving a rock star a rest"!
Utahraptor: You guys are the worst.
T-Rex: But how?
Utahraptor: See this comment on the left: "OMG, I fell down the stairs. Nice! Finally, I'm not slacking off any more!"

T-Rex: Oh my gosh, Utahraptor, that is some TINY bit of rude humor for the young and the old!
Utahraptor: It's been a memorable two weeks indeed!
T-Rex: You know, some of it I actually enjoy!
