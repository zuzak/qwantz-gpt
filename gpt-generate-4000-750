T-Rex: I would like to have an inclined treadmill, so that I could build an indoor skateboarding track.  Am I that crazy?
T-Rex: Am I that crazy... TO DREAM?

T-Rex: To forget...
T-Rex: To find myself...
T-Rex: To be stuck in a machine that turns ACHM... INTO A CHEAP SUBSTITUTE

T-Rex: To be stranded in a house that you can't freefall to...
Utahraptor: Aw, T-Rex!  This can be done in a minute!

T-Rex: A sudden, quick realization dawned on me!  The world is collapsing and I do not want to skate anymore!
Utahraptor: Oh well!  I'll be back later to see you later!
T-Rex: Oh well!  I'll be the one to forget!

T-Rex: The fact that I have the time of day of determining if I'm good at something else is a property of me, an INFINITE MAN.
Utahraptor: That I am not!
T-Rex: That I am not!
