T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!

T-Rex: I will consider it as a public service!

T-Rex: For I too have made a career of pointing out the successes of my enemies!
Dromiceiomimus: Indeed!
T-Rex: Indeed!

Utahraptor: So let's hear what you've written so far! What?
T-Rex: A bunch of stuff: self-help books, websites dedicated towards smothering feelings, blogs and articles about veining away at the problem!

T-Rex: Crammed together, these booksighs shed no more light on the problem! Nor do I intend to!
Utahraptor: Too bad!
T-Rex: No, man! Shut up!
T-Rex: Shut up!!

T-Rex: I finally made it back from the dentist, and was gored up to my current ken. Now I have nothing but good things to say about the sex life I now enjoy.
T-Rex: You -
T-Rex: YOU
