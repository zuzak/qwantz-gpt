T-Rex: I've made a fantastic discovery: a discovery bound to send the music theorists back to their dusty old drawing boards! For you see....

T-Rex: I've discovered how to turn most any love song into a sea shanty!

T-Rex: You'll need a boat, okay? A canoe, a hook, a sewing machine, a newspaper.
Dromiceiomimus: A boat?
T-Rex: A canoe!
Dromiceiomimus: A boat themed shanty.
T-Rex: Okay!

Utahraptor: So what happens when you get to the island of Lesbos?
T-Rex: There's a giant island with a boat!

Utahraptor: There's a boat that turns every love song into a sea shanty!
T-Rex: In my opinion, the end!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, AT THE GUITARS TIRE MEAT STORE!
T-Rex: May I surprise you, Dromiceiomimus, a young prince who was starving, with a boat?
Dromiceiomimus: You're not at the tour!
T-Rex: You're in fact older than I, because my name is T-Rex!
