T-Rex: Not every medium has to offer analogies to tell a different story!

T-Rex: But every has to provide an accessible, yet powerful example!

T-Rex: Often, analogies are lost because they're too hard to recreate.  For example, imagine I could take a ride in a car and suddenly I am a tiny woman.  Tiny women?  How can I tell?
T-Rex: So I am a tiny woman in a car!

Utahraptor: Analogies aren't as hard to come by as facts!
T-Rex: How hard can it be?

Utahraptor: Well, is it really that hard?  How can I get in to a party and sit down?  There's a lot of online pressure!
T-Rex: There is!  How do I get in?  How do I get out?
Utahraptor: You're saying there are no facts presented to me in this example.

T-Rex: Yep!  I was simply trying to figure out if there were any analogies that'd make me want to visit historical figures.
T-Rex: Yes!
T-Rex: SO: there are many.
