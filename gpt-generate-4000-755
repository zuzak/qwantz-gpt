T-Rex: Dang girl, you know I wanna kiss you baby!

T-Rex: Girl you know if I get your consent I'm gonna press my lips up against the nice parts of your head!

T-Rex: Damn girl, I think I just bit my tongue! Yeah, I got that guy good, babe. I bit right into the prehensile mean that lives inside my face but you know as soon as blood stops pouring out of it I'm gonna slip that flattened fleshy tube right inside your mouth.
T-Rex: You know I'ma position the moist entrance to my digestive tract up against your slick little teeth so that tasty juices will flow freely out of them.

T-Rex: Girl, is there a piece missing? It hurts a lot.
Utahraptor: Yeah, but you kiss it sometimes and it doesn't happen over and over.

T-Rex: Girl you should really visit my grave and just leave, not even if I get you to wash it.
Utahraptor: I do wash clothes sometimes and that's nice.
T-Rex: Girl that I could be my own boss but you gotta clean 'em every day!

Narrator: SHORTLY:
T-Rex: Dear diary!
T-Rex: You know I sometimes keep aveggers in my diary to let me know where they're at.
