T-Rex: Anyway!  Relationships are for the young and the criminally insane.  What's of real importance is that I saw a car dealership ad yesterday advertising that "no reasonable offer will be refused"!

T-Rex: Well, yeah!

T-Rex: Oooh, ads like that burn my biscuits.  Of course they're not going to refuse a reasonable offer!  That's what makes it so reasonable!  And worse, since "reasonable" can be a very subjective word, it's not really saying anything beyond "Hey, I won't refuse an offer for reasons that I personally find irrational."

Utahraptor: It sounds like you've put a lot of thought into this, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's a thought fueled by rage!!

T-Rex: It just bothers me that they're trying to make it sounds like a big thing when it's just business as usual!  That's deceptive.
Utahraptor: That's advertising!
T-Rex: So annoying! Plus, I saw this other ad on the same day that said "everyone approved O.A.C."

T-Rex: O.A.C. stands for "on approved credit"!  Everyone's approved if they're approved?!  Aaargh!
T-Rex: I could make some joke about tautological advertisements, but I find them too annoying to laugh at right now.
