T-Rex: Isn't it interesting how "maroon" can mean both "left alone" and refer to a dark purpley colour?

T-Rex: THE CORRECT ANSWER HERE IS "YES", OKAY??

T-Rex: The colour sense derives from the colour sense, which is a thing, right? And the sense of touch derives from the sense of a touch - WHICH SUCKS DUESIDES. Anyway, how come we use language? How come we use archaic, archaic ways of speaking so we can say "mourning", "in", "aging", "in", "in", "and"?
Dromiceiomimus: I think the answer is that we're all super dumb and don't know a single thing about any language.
T-Rex: I GUESS WE'LL JUST TELL PEOPLE.

Utahraptor: Man, I wish we'd stop making stupid mistakes like that all the time!
T-Rex: WEAK WILLING AND IMAGINING QUANTUM BECAUSE IT'S
Utahraptor: SORRY GUESS I JUST ATE MY HEAD!
T-Rex: HAH HAH HAH

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: what are the odds of you, a man immortal, not knowing what the future holds for him, even with all the crazy theories he possibly has?
T-Rex: *gasp*
T-Rex: I FOOLED THE PAST
