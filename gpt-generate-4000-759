Narrator: IT'S WEDNESDAY!  HOW ARE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
T-Rex: I would rate my relationships:

T-Rex: Pretty okay!

Dromiceiomimus: My relationships are fine too!  I broke up with the guy I was dating, but it's cool.
T-Rex: What was the reason?
Dromiceiomimus: He punned too often?  And they weren't even, like, good puns.  They were always the same puns.
T-Rex: Sometimes you want to eat corn without hearing how corny it is.

Utahraptor: My relationships are fine too!
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: We comedians love 'em, and in exchange we pay for his performances, we make him laugh!
Utahraptor: We comedians love 'em like it's a bad party!
T-Rex: I know, right?  We comedians love 'em like it's a great comedy!
