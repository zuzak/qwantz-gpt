T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! Oh MAN.  I'll never say these words again.
T-Rex: They're ending here.

Narrator: T-REX AND THE DEVIL SENT LETTER

T-Rex: In retrospect, I should have written, "Here lies T-Rex, my friend!"
Dromiceiomimus: But what happens when you write your friend a letter? When you finally receive it, throw away, say, the post office?
T-Rex: What if I wrote it all again? I'd have over EIGHT BILLION TIMES of it still left!

Utahraptor: Hey, have you sent your last letter to your MOST DEFINITELY PROFESSION MEMBERS?
T-Rex: ERROR 14: dead!

T-Rex: The checks were sent CLASSIC, and the "classics" I included in those "classics" weren't action figures but "cultist" symbols for the childish childish childish cult of obsession!
Utahraptor: Wow. I'd like to go back in time and tell him how I fell in love.
T-Rex: The ok for now!

T-Rex: But the 14th is up!  I'll probably just write what I want to remember.  A guy named "T-Rex" didn't exist!
Utahraptor: Aw, T-Rex!  You're on, um, the first and last day of school.
T-Rex: The next day I go to the library to read some detective stories!
Utahraptor: What are you doing? You don't even mention school!
T-Rex: The next day I go to the grocery store to pick up some books!
Utahraptor: What are you doing? I don't see you on the first day of school!
T-Rex: The next day I go to the board game store to pick up some new games!
