T-Rex: Folks say you should learn a new word every day. At that rate, you'd need a language with 30,000 words in it!

T-Rex: That's actually not that many so I guess we're good!!

T-Rex: So today's Word of the Day means "a process whereby bacterium incorporates foreign DNA brought in by a contact lens and resulting in a reconstructed English-speaking genome."
Dromiceiomimus: That's original but transformed "d00d00" into other original words that I shouldn't have invented.
T-Rex: I know!!

Utahraptor: Today's Word of the Day: "TEARS".
T-Rex: This word is definitely unfamiliar though!

Utahraptor: So we see two competing claims to this word: the first being "starched", wherein the starched word is translated as "disappointment" and the second as "disappointment with the grain"".#
T-Rex: No way! I'm 100% behind this word.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: "BORDER" TAKES THE SAME BORDER, AND ALSO REPLACES ANY OTHER WORD:
T-Rex: No, wait, shoot , I'll still be able to say the word "barbarian" and "heresy" and the rest will fall through the cracks!!
