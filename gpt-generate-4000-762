T-Rex: I have the best joke for Dromiceiomimus. You are one of the few mammals who can do both the both the both the 'o' and the 'x' ways of saying different umpteen different things!

T-Rex: Jeopardy: one-on-one against the mighty monster known only as "Chocopa").

T-Rex: One-on-one against the greatest threat to existence: the greatest threat to knowledge itself!
Dromiceiomimus: And?
T-Rex: NO, I mean, look at me.
T-Rex: I'm actually in a prime position to make jokes about Chocopa. It rules while also making jokes against me!

Utahraptor: Yeah, but what would he be doing if he knew he'd be laughed at for hours?
T-Rex: For hundreds of hours.

T-Rex: And in case that wasn't clear, I've been going door-to-door beating ass telling people that I'm serious about answering the question, and people have been really interested in reading my OCCUPIED OPINIONS.
Utahraptor: Sounds like a good dude.
T-Rex: Hah! I guess what I'm saying?

T-Rex: ISN'T ALL OF THOSE OPINIONS?
T-Rex: MAYBE SOMEONE SHOULDEN HEAR ME SUDDENLY / NOW ?
T-Rex: DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO TELL ?
