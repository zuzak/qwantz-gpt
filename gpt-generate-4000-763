T-Rex: "Amelia and Antonio Tony decided to no longer have sex!  This was some pretty exceptional character development.  They were both, I think, way wrong."

T-Rex: "They should've done it by now.  They're both characters in and writer of the show are way overzealous in their criticism.  Why don't they blow your mind?"

T-Rex: "The nudity was nice, too, but it wasn't great.  It made the episode seem a little less awesome."
Utahraptor: "It wasn't like the nudity was awesome."

T-Rex: "It was incredibly boring and empty."
Utahraptor: "B-but there was a theme too."
T-Rex: "There was an odd beat, somehow."

T-Rex: "It was surreal."
Utahraptor: "It was odd."
T-Rex: "At the end, I thought, 'Okay, at least this is an ending, and all that's changed is how I see things.' "
Utahraptor: "It was a weird episode."

T-Rex: "It was wonderful.  Sometimes, with the right notes, you can make a revelation that's entirely new."
Utahraptor: "Hovering over the numbers a little though, I think it becomes clear that this was a very disappointing episode."
T-Rex: "At least this is an ending to a very disappointing beginning."
