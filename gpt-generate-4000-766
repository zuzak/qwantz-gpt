T-Rex: It's been what - four thousand years of civilization? Five thousand? How come we haven't solved all the problems and answered all the questions?

T-Rex: I think, as a people, we have kind of dropped the ball!

T-Rex: In many ways, we're the bad guy in the marriage: everyone thinks differently, and living together is a possibility gone bad.  But ours is a very unique and successful civilization, and if we fail to live up to our potential we're going to end up looking for work in various forms!

Utahraptor: Who are you talking to?
T-Rex: Utahraptor! The guy who comes to my dinner party and tells me I'm great and that I've broken up with his girlfriend!  There's a sign outside that says, "SOMEONE'S DATING!"

Utahraptor: Are you really throwing away so much genetic material?
T-Rex: I was!
T-Rex: I was just throwing away 2,000 years of MY youth and marriage.  I was kidding!  I was throwing away the chance to share the knowledge and skills I need to become a better civilization.  But you know what? Turns out the reason we've never colonized the other side of the planet is that we have these diseases and cultures that wouldn't have otherwise been discovered!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Oh, let's not rush to judgment about marital happiness!
T-Rex: I've GOT a good one ready!
