T-Rex: Hey, English! Why you gotta be so sexist?

Narrator: WHY YOU GOTTA BE SO SEXIST, ENGLISH

T-Rex: Why you gotta have a word like "old maid", chock full of negative connotations, and only English Wikipedia has an English Wikipedia that says is even WRONG depends on whether you agree or disagree with me in one way or the other!
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe you'd like to know what English has to offer, instead of English just saying how awesome it is.
T-Rex: English just totally exploded!

Utahraptor: I think this has been pretty fatal for open source in the sense that it's got folks from all over arguing about what it is!
T-Rex: Seriously?

Utahraptor: Like what? Like everybody thinks that BASICALLY, BASICALLY, BASICALLY ADORABLE, when in the real world, there's women and guys?
T-Rex: Utahraptor! In real life?
Utahraptor: There's a Wikipedia about that. But here's one for you: Wikipedia is about English!

Narrator: LATER: IN ALBUMS FOR ALL THOSE MEN WHO DON'T LIKE WOMEN WHO ARE BEING WALKED INTO
T-Rex: Oh wait!! In English, there's a picture of me and a very particular message on a microfiche that reads "but you know what's best for ME!"
T-Rex: I don't see how that's possible!
