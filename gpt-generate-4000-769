T-Rex: I am a guy who's really not that religious!  I don't really know anything about it.  I'm just a guy who just wants some religious head way done with this.

T-Rex: For instance!

T-Rex: Okay, Dromiceiomimus, you want me to tell you about the first place I ever met the Devil!
Dromiceiomimus: Yeah!  I was talking to the Devil at breakfast and he was talking to me about ice cream.  I guess I was starting to get fed up with not having any control over food, and so made him try chocolate.  It wasn't that bad!  We had a little bit of a fight.  The fight really did go down an interesting note:

Utahraptor: Did you ever think that maybe you could have a better life if you tried religious beliefs while also having access to true love?
T-Rex: I did!

Utahraptor: And it really didn't work?  My parents didn't want me to marry the Devil, yet they still thought marrying me was the best move.  How did you figure?  I guess you had hard questions to ask!
T-Rex: Well!  I answer them!

Narrator: THE END
Narrator: IF YOU TRIED RELIGIONAL MOMENTUM, IT WOULD STOP US ALL
Narrator: the end

Narrator: IN CONCLUSION, FURTHER CONFUSING THAT "ICE CURSE" IS A MORE POWERFUL ANALYMM / GOD-SUIRING SONG / THAN ANY OTHER SOUND / EVENTUALLY, THAT I WILL NEVER BE REMEMBER ME FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS
