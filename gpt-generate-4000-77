T-Rex: I have solved the greatest of social problems! I have!

T-Rex: IT'S PASSED SOCIETY THROUGH TECHNICALLY UNDER THE AWESOME EXPLOSION OF "THEORY"

T-Rex: In fact, the only way to solve all the problems is to pay attention to what other people are doing, and what they're doing better! I'll tell you what's going on in the world: a Nobel Prize!
Dromiceiomimus: That's technically true, T-Rex! But it's a shame you're not a part of it.
T-Rex: I will, as a way... To Bust SOME Friends Over Dinner!

Utahraptor: Is it a problem with dating that I'm always looking for excuses to be famous?
T-Rex: That's true!

Utahraptor: How often do you find "famous" is a pretty sensitive issue, T-Rex.  Every time you're going to impress someone you'll need to make allowances.
T-Rex: I wouldn't be able to follow through, though, because I'd be remembered less!  How would you tell if you've been VERY popular than planned?

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX HAS BEEN ADDRESSING DINOSAURS!
T-Rex: Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: Yep!
T-Rex: I figured we'd have a full day last week!  I figure we're in a deep slumber slumber because we're still making new friends!
