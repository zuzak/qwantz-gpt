T-Rex: Utahraptor, come quick!

T-Rex: I ate a gross fly!!

T-Rex: It was by accident! He just flew in while I was yawning! It might still be alive inside me and THAT'S GROSS, THIS WHOLE THIS IS SO GROSS. Bleh!
T-Rex: Utahraptor! You should be five!
T-Rex: I deserved better!!

Utahraptor: You're totally right! Also, I ate a gross fly which, bighthand, also blasted you a steam-whispered lunch that later on I somehow forgot to take back.
T-Rex: What? No, I didn't!

Narrator: THAT'S RIGHT, BOO!
T-Rex: It's so cool to be different all the time!
