T-Rex: I have some bad news.  For one, there's no way I know what's important!

T-Rex: There's no way I know what makes me happy.

T-Rex: For example, there's no way I know what makes me sad.
Dromiceiomimus: Sure there is!  And I tried summarizing this to you, but it's just a dog!
T-Rex: I knew it!  I just wasn't ready for it right now.  Happy?

Utahraptor: I think I got kind of sad, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's okay!

Utahraptor: I thought you were going to say something new, like with songs more in sync with your favourite musician?
T-Rex: Okay YEAH it was the perfect solution!  But I soon realized: even when I'm sad, I'm still simultaneously simultaneously afeeling sad and drained!
