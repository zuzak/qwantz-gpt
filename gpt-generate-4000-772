T-Rex: Attention, folks with low self-esteem!

T-Rex: Pretty sure you've got no-one to blame for that but yourself, but there's no shame in effort!

T-Rex: Another reason self-esteem is found in everyone is because of the "Oh crap oh crap" feeling that comes from times when things didn't work out so well for a reason. You've got to look it up! There's this phrase that everybody has used, but you don't want to hear it: "There's the phrase! It works with people without feelings!"

Utahraptor: I think that or you could just hear the phrase reported in books and movies for sure!
T-Rex: Whatever!

T-Rex: It's so great, you know? There's this phrase in a book that says "Here's the story of how a frustrated, disillusioned, spiritually-deadbody said 'I don't matter, I'm in control' and was off his you-know-what for a few hours. Hah hah hah!"
Utahraptor: It's such a good phrase!
T-Rex: It really is, you know?

T-Rex: It gets me thinking about the other awesome phrases everyone has used but idiolect they all ended up being really good too! Like "It's too bad everything worked out in the end" or "I don't think about what I might have done differently if I'd had a balanced diet"
T-Rex: Man!
T-Rex: And I love that I have that weird "how to" phrase again!
