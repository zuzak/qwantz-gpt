T-Rex: I've entered a poetry contest!

T-Rex: I can't lose!

T-Rex: Right, Dromiceiomimus? I'm a good poet, right?
Dromiceiomimus: Sure! Although I've not heard much of your poetry!
T-Rex: I can assure you that my poetry is great, unlike our current department of state!

Utahraptor: So you want to enter?
T-Rex: No, just a need to spread some c~~*ng!

Utahraptor: Really! You're just going to let some crappy poetry get in your system?
T-Rex: That's what I'm saying! Get your morning report, "Shakespeare in Rye: Good Poems, Not Bad Poems!"
Utahraptor: I just want to hear your poetry!
