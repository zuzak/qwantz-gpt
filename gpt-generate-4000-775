T-Rex: "The best part of Terminator movies are the non-robot characters who never even travel through time" - NOBODY.

T-Rex: NOBODY HAS EVER SAID THAT

Dromiceiomimus: I think we can all agree that this is a pretty great script. What are your other script, Dromiceiomimus?
T-Rex: I don't know, a 90s one. I honestly don't think I've ever seen one!
Dromiceiomimus: Oh, that sounds like the script for Wimpy Turkey!
T-Rex: Wimpy Turkey is the worst! The worst being a woman with a heart of gold. The worst being a Turkish who has never kissed a woman. The worst being A NON-TIMORICAL TRADE ENGENDER.

Utahraptor: Do you have any ideas on this?
T-Rex: I do! See, I always feel bad about letting this one down.

T-Rex: This is what happens when you let a great idea get a second chance! This is what I'm saying! And I'm not talking about dying. This is what I'm saying!
Utahraptor: I don't have a single best idea ever.
T-Rex: Oh, please! This is my worst nightmare, my Utahraptor! This is what if all the greatest minds of history were all dead.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX IS A REAL PERSON:
T-Rex: T-Rex, if you were a real person, you'd be a super interesting character! I could see myself playing you for the first time ever!
Utahraptor: Sounds great!
T-Rex: I know! I think I'd be interesting if only I had that awesome "boner by my side" look.
