T-Rex: I have been thinking, and I have come to the conclusion that it would be pretty sweet to be called as a witness in some sort of murder trial!

T-Rex: Pretty sweet indeed, my friends! Pretty sweet indeed!

Dromiceiomimus: Why do you think it would be so great to be Witness No. 1?
T-Rex: I think it's because sometimes people like to talk about Witness No. 2!
Dromiceiomimus: Yeah, but that became a thing in the early '90s!
T-Rex: That's insane! I never even heard the trial start!

Utahraptor: You already have your own TV show?
T-Rex: Yes! It's a lot of Word of the Day parody lyrics and all. Yeah, it's a lot of Word of the Day thing.

Utahraptor: Man, I hear that! You're under arrest for "terrorism".
T-Rex: I'M under arrest for "terrorism"!
Utahraptor: I'M under arrest for "terrorism"!
T-Rex: You fools! You think you can't hear my case!
Utahraptor: I hear them!

T-Rex: Oh, they do! Consider my reasoning in turn: your cowardly distortion of the court's true identity, today's trial, and a befuddled stranger waiting to be discovered!
T-Rex: MY PALATABLE
