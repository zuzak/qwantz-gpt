T-Rex: And in this future-nation there would be trees! And lakes! And play lots of games!
T-Rex: Also, there would be bike rides!

Utahraptor: And in this future-nation there would be games!

T-Rex: And in this future-nation there would be scientists!

T-Rex: And in this future-nation there would be a team of astronauts to take them to the moon!
Utahraptor: And in this future-nation there would be a robot version of yourself!
T-Rex: And you wish to be happy with that?

T-Rex: Then go to the moon and play marbles!
Utahraptor: MOMENTS.
T-Rex: But THEN!
T-Rex: You HAVE to be at least 18 years old to play marbles!
