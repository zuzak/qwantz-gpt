T-Rex: I have noticed that eating different foods has different physiological effects on myself. There must be some 'balanced diet' that maximizes the agreeable effects of such nourishment!

T-Rex: However, as I already discovered, there are serious limits to this.

T-Rex: For one thing, there's no way to know which foods are causing the changes: the presence of other foods can have a profound effect on our sense of self! For example, is apple juice the cause? And what of whole fruits and vegetables, than which have also been shown to have a role in the development of allergies?

Utahraptor: I find that story haughty, T-Rex!
T-Rex: You don't like it?

Utahraptor: Yeah. I don't like it.
T-Rex: Really? You don't like it? (That was a rhetorical question, and not a question!)
Utahraptor: Yeah. Well then. I guess I'll just join the ranks of McDonald's employees and not callously swallow a whole bunch of subs: SUBMETAPHICS.

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear memoir: I was embarrassed to tell my friends last night that I had been a Subway dude!
T-Rex: For many of my life he's been Subway!
