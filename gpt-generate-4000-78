T-Rex:Alright dudes, let's find out who's REALLY THE SICKEST MAN alive today!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, ask me why we can't seeing movies in our living rooms.
Dromiceiomimus: Because it's not working, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Hollah!!

T-Rex: Now, I'm going to go visit the movies later.
Utahraptor: But our modern technology is FULL OF FOLLOWERS OF FEAR and KNOWLEDGE, and it's very hard to get excited about recent news!

Utahraptor: What would you say to someone who's worried about their LIFETIME in a car accident?
T-Rex: Same thing, T-Rex.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, you're the reason we can't see movies in our homes, don't you think?
T-Rex: Seriously? Well, ask me why we can't see movies in our living rooms, and I'll tell you why: I have issues with distractedness!

T-Rex: Huh?
