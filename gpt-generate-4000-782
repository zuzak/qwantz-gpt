T-Rex: I have read several books over the past several years, some of them longer works, and, on closer inspection, I think I have come up with my own.

T-Rex: Looks like this book has a lot of greats too!

T-Rex: For example, Dromiceiomimus, yours is a collection of fairy tales, one story at a time! One story at a time!
Dromiceiomimus: Sure!
T-Rex: I think ours is more like a VHS tape, with lots of stories in one place.
Dromiceiomimus: Sure!

Utahraptor: So what's the story with the portmanteau?
T-Rex: UTAHRAPTOR!

T-Rex: What's with the corker? That's almost always good!
Utahraptor: Oh, I always felt like I liked it.
T-Rex: I feel a firm grasp on myself.
Utahraptor: Geez. It just seems that way to me!

Narrator: BUT IT'S HAPPENING:
T-Rex: It's thawning now and I've left behind the terrible past. The ghost of Eve! And her. Curse. And she haunts us all.
T-Rex: Hasta la vista, Eden!
