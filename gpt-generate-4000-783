T-Rex: Okay, so I get that Spider-Man is into the "woman" thing, and tries to evince great powers by talking to someone else. Hah! Wow, that'd be SO GOOD.

T-Rex: But then I worry that if I talk to her, she'll start imagining my power and abilities, and I'll be able to use them in a way that will be difficult to match against a tall guy!

T-Rex: So I go to the super strength club, and we talk for a bit! Then, after I explain that I'm a woman, and that I don't fetishize physical strength, I become EVEN MORE WOMAN-TIRED! I start going over my own adventures, and now I'm SUCH A fan of every woman I've ever met!

Utahraptor: How's that?
T-Rex: FANTASTIC.

Utahraptor: I don't fetishize physical strength, T-Rex, but I'm disappointed that I didn't see any of it yesterday!
T-Rex: Oh. Um, I'm also looking forward to every woman who's ever had a text asking why I don't fetishize physical strength.

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Man! Man!
T-Rex: Man!!
