T-Rex: There was a mouse in my house last night.
T-Rex: A mouse! In my house! That rhymes!

T-Rex: It was so gross.

T-Rex: How can I forget about this mouse?
Dromiceiomimus: It was inside my computer.
T-Rex: How did that happen?
Dromiceiomimus: It was inside my dromiceiomimbus!
T-Rex: Oh yeah? Well, that'score gone. But I said, "gone" because the mouse is back in copyright.

Utahraptor: You want some updated copyright law?
T-Rex: I do!

Utahraptor: Your mouse was in my computer's CD-RIDDEN CD-ROM, and now it's back in copyright!
T-Rex: There's nothing I can do?
Utahraptor: I want my epitaph to be awesome!

T-Rex: And I propose changing the name of EVERY film to "H.A.T.L.D."
