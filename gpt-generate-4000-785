T-Rex: I just realized that no women have ever been to the moon! ONLY DUDES. DUDES WHO RETURNED AS MEN.

T-Rex: Apparently, you need a lifetime of accumulated knowledge about the universe to return as a man as a moon!

T-Rex: Wait - that's not a problem! I've got EVEN MORE INTERESTING, INTERESTING, ETIQUETICAL HOMOPHONES THAT I CAN CREATE UNIVERSES with!
Dromiceiomimus: I'll create universes where men take over!
T-Rex: Exactly! SEE?

Utahraptor: Entire universes are created equal parts of equally-sexy girlfriends!
T-Rex: That sounds just terrific!

Utahraptor: Our universe is like a parking lot, in that every gift gets a second chance, just as every other gift gets a chance to the very core, where it succeeds at every other task! And yet, there's no question that our universe is: alike, but different.
T-Rex: We haven't even scratched the surface of this exciting new field of SCIENCE

Narrator: MUCH LATER:
T-Rex: Yes my universe is like that, except I'm a different man!
T-Rex: And that's a good thing!
