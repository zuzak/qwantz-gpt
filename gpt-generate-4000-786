T-Rex: I just stepped on a rosebush and I'd like to know: who the hell is responsible for plants having thorns on 'em??
God: EVOLUTION
T-Rex: FINE.

T-Rex: Which the hell evolutionary forces are responsible for plants having thorns on 'em??

Dromiceiomimus: I think it's that animals eat the plants, so plants with thorns get eaten less!
T-Rex: ANIMALS. I knew it!! Animals are ALWAYS trying to play me as if my name was Sega!
T-Rex: Well, if you'll excuse me, I'M off to go eat parts of a cow and feel even MORE justified than normal, thanks!!

Utahraptor: Thorns are modified stems: roses technically have "prickles", not thorns.
T-Rex: OKAY FINE WHATEVER

Utahraptor: Also, the evolutionary forces that produced rose prickles include being able to attach to other vegetation easier which helps growth, and being able to trap wind-blown sand which protects a rose's roots. If you want to revenge yourself, dude, revenge yourself on sand.
T-Rex: WAY AHEAD OF YOU

Narrator: EARLIER:
T-Rex: Hey! HEY!
T-Rex: Quicksand more like quickBLAND

{{Image title: the wikipedia page for quicksand makes the incredible claim that fully 3% of all films in the 60s featured someone sinking into quicksand.  apparently i need to watch more romantic comedies from the 60s because i have long maintained that MAN, that genre could use a few well-placed quicksand scenes}}
{{Email subject: don't even get me started on quicksand roses}}
