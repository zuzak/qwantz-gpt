T-Rex:  I think I have sex addiction, but like, for food!  Is it sex addiction?  I don't know!  I JUST have a creeping fear of eating food.

T-Rex:  Oh my gosh no!  I can't eat ANYTHING.  I've got to start eating more and more and more food, and then, you know?  I'll have to eat less and less food.

Utahraptor:  That sounds like a good idea!
T-Rex:  With that in mind, I will decide to eat more food.

T-Rex:  Ah, good news!  My fear is unfounded!  I am eating less and eating more, and I'm seriously eating less.
Utahraptor:  So if you can't eat anything, at least you're not sexing up for a forsaken, desiccated stomach?

T-Rex:  Food is for sassy people!
Utahraptor:  I guess!  And the thing is, you can't really tell from looking at someone's body.  It's all guesswork!
T-Rex:  Maybe I'll wonder how my body looks after eating, and then Dromiceiomimus will be sad again!

Utahraptor:  That's nothing, T-Rex!  You can't really tell from looking at someone's body.  They're just you.
T-Rex:  That means I'm doomed to being a tastefulateur!
Utahraptor:  *T-Rex, I have low self-esteem; please, help me out, of dieting or job or whatever!
T-Rex:  *Dromiceiomimus, you have low self-esteem; please, help me out by helping me out!
Utahraptor:  Good to hear!
