T-Rex: I have a great idea!  A way to add DRAMA to our everyday lives.

T-Rex: Let's all promise to meet in a pub somewhere in 10 years!

T-Rex: It'll be rad, Dromiceiomimus!  It'll be an element of predictability in an otherwise chaotic universe.  It'll let us know that no matter what we do, we'll still be able to see each other in a decade!  We'll be able to catch up.  We'll have a plan in our lives!  It'll be SO MUCH FUN.
Dromiceiomimus: I guess, sure!  But what if one of us is on the run and we ever do get caught?

Utahraptor: Sure!

Utahraptor: The rest of us decide to hang around and watch cartoons or whatever.  But we're too superstitious and paranoid to really be that trusting.  It'll be fun to imagine we're the only ones doing it, but we'll have to believe the rest of us are just fooling around.  Is it cool to have a plan in life?

T-Rex: It's cool to think we are!  It's even cool to think we could be so smart and awesome!
Utahraptor: I'm sorry we all ended up in different timelines, T-Rex!
Utahraptor: We ended up in different universes, remember!
