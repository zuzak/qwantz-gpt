T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!

T-Rex: I will consider it as a public service!

T-Rex: To begin: your house is too small and your porch is slightly out of scale! And you didn't feed your dog enough! And sometimes your kids cry all the time!
T-Rex: Ouch for having done that.

T-Rex: You've got to change your life, you guys!
Utahraptor: I thought I'd change my life because I thought you'd do it too!

T-Rex: Yep! And I've got to tell you, my story is one of a lifetime's worth of failure.
Utahraptor: I've got a friend in particular I can't wait to hear! How can I thank?

T-Rex: My friend?
