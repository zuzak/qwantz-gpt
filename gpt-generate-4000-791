T-Rex: Yesterday was a very special day for me as a woman!  Today was a woman who was more concerned with prideful AND sexy-filled excuses to visit the nice folks of the past (who died anyway, Dromiceiomimus!)

T-Rex: On the other hand, today is a women who's proud AND confident and who's proud NOT of being Sassy!

T-Rex: A day that has brought me closer to the truth, Dromiceiomimus!  A day that has reminded me of how I missed my own parents (of all people), that I've worried about what I wasn't living up to, and that perhaps that was true for today.
Dromiceiomimus: A day that has reminded you of your BARE HANDS in the past, too (looks like today), and of how you've left your T-Rex figurines hanging above the school you love (looks on smile)
T-Rex: A minstrel show!

Utahraptor: A woman with proudest things to do today?  A woman with proudest things to do today!
T-Rex: Yes!

Utahraptor: Today is a good day I think for confessing my true feelings!  I will haunt this house and this lady.  I will hold my ground, and I will stomp this house.
T-Rex: I will become a regular person again, a Utahraptor!

Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: Today is a good day for learning how to dance, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Aw boo!
