Narrator: COMICS WITH SUDDEN CHANGES IN GENDER
T-Rex: What a nice day to go out and do manly things. Maybe stomp on some trees?

T-Rex: Hmm?

T-Rex: Maybe build some manliness manliness manliness trees?
Dromiceiomimus: I have always suspected that gender-neutral pronouns are a pain in the butt!
T-Rex: They're so hard!

Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex, calm down!
T-Rex: You can't say that!

Utahraptor: I've always wondered: are there situations in life that are completely without gender-neutral pronouns?
T-Rex: Well, there are some, silly one!

T-Rex: I just hope I don't tell anyone I stomped on an elderly lady and then left her some cardboard boxes because then maybe she'll pick up on that.  I need to learn how to pierce a woman's skin, you know?
Utahraptor: Another success!

T-Rex: Yep! And, since I can't pronounce the word "kalapea", I can't use "kalapea".
T-Rex: Probably!
T-Rex: OR, I could use "rah-apea".
