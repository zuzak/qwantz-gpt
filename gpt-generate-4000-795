T-Rex: I have finished a new novel! This is my best novel yet, for the simple reason that it includes one critical aspect:

T-Rex: A sex scene!

T-Rex: Sex Scene One: You (usually) have sexy sex, and then you, my friend, have an audience (usually) sex scene Two!
T-Rex: There, suddenly you have a roaring success!

T-Rex: Now, I feel strong! For the simple reason that I have achieved SO MUCH during this ordeal!
Utahraptor: Sex Scene Two: Ok, I'll have a sex scene For The Intense Crowd.

T-Rex: Ok, I'll have a sexy sex scene For The Long List.
Utahraptor: Sex Scene Three: You like it when I sex up others, sometimes I will try to be discreet.
T-Rex: You will like it, even if it is just a little tongue?

T-Rex: You will love it when I put a toy penis in my mouth.
