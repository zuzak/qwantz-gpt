T-Rex: So light behaves like both a particle and a wave, right?  And I'm representing particles in the radially curved Universe we find ourselves in!  And particles don't interact with light either, even though it's particle after particle after particle after particle after particle after particle after particle after particle after.

T-Rex: Not bad for a video game, less bad for a boring old mystery!

T-Rex: It turns out the game's engine doesn't support particles waaaay beyond the obvious way they interact with light, and that sucks for a lot of reasons: if you run into a particle somehow that's not good for anything, and you don't want them to be good for anything, and you're stuck forever because you don't know how to react with light to get them to work.  So you'd have to design your game around them!  INECAIIIIIGENCE.

Utahraptor: So how's it work-as-usual with AR games?
T-Rex: W- Well, I guess I could design a lot more than "light interacts with light" -

T-Rex: - but, you know, not in the way you're describing it.  In "ASK PROFESSOR SCIENCE", she's a particle physicist who has a beefy toque hanging from her desk, and in "ASK THE DEVIL" he's just a spectator who wants to catch a glimpse of emerald green monoliths.  In "DROMICEIOMIMUS" she's a model citizen who has way too many tattoos.  In "ORIGINAL SONG UNLOCKED"! she's a loner who just wants to stop throwing words in the face of beatable death: she's just a person who is less intense than you.

T-Rex: In "PERSONAL NARRATIVE" she's somebody else throwing her own laundry in the direction of death, and in "HISTORY" she's somebody else who believes the Titanic sank because they didn't know they could Bunny Haine!  In "ANIMAL COMICS" she's somebody else committing murder after she put her hand up t-bone for the cause.  In the beginning!
Narrator: THESE ARE ALL DATES.
