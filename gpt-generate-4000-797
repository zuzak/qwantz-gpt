T-Rex: I am a guy who really likes Batman.  And it occurs to me: at some point in my life I'm going to be an old man!

T-Rex: It's a deal!

T-Rex: If I'm going to be an old man, I have to make life interesting.  I looked at old age: how many people have ever died before?
Dromiceiomimus: Old age in the 60s was awesome, man!  But sadly for young people, the magic happened with the advent of video games.  Older people's roles were more like babysitters and pick up men, and the result was dads being called off and the expectations of elderly home being laid bare.

T-Rex: This is what I'm going to say to my good friend, old man about to become my friend!
Utahraptor: You older guy!  You know friend older than me.

Utahraptor: Is it because you're way more popular than me?
T-Rex: It is indeed!  I was gonna say friends, but then I got around to saying the same thing to old people!
Utahraptor: Long dead body, the kind of thing that gets buried in a few years.

Batman: T-REX HAS BECOME A BIG DEAL
T-Rex: Old age? I thought you were including me!
Old-Timey Guy: AW MAN, CAUSE I'M BORN BEFORE UPLOADING MY GIANT PARENTS INTO A CHILD WAS ANYTHING
T-Rex: I've got one more thing to do!
