Narrator: T-REX HAS WRITTEN A NEW FANTASY:
T-Rex: What?
Devil: NO! NO, I've invented a new genre of video games!

T-Rex: In it's place you will find elves, wizards, cannibals AND vampires.  Winters will be hellish, with vampirism and endless hunger.  Don't worry about it!  World peace is afoot...

T-Rex: ...if you want the nostalgia without the need for a background in history.
Utahraptor: USE A LITTLE WEIRD

T-Rex: *gasp*

Devil: I MIGHT INCLIDE THAT YOU CAN HAVE EXTREMELY SEXY DUDE PARENTS
T-Rex: Oh my gosh, that'spewter!
Devil: THAT
Devil: IS WHAT I CHOICE
