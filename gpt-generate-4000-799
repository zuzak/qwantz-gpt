T-Rex: How can I be assured of a successful future if I don't inventing new ways to say "Yes"?

T-Rex: Being consistent is the key to happiness!

T-Rex: Confidence must come through in things. They can't be taken for granted! They're things we don't have. They're things that we can't take away from others.
Dromiceiomimus: I think you're starting to overanalyze things!
T-Rex: I guess!

T-Rex: You could say that if I had a machine that I copied from another computer, that I would do some things differently if it came back as the same person!
Utahraptor: Boo!

Utahraptor: Say what? That's amazing. That's amazing!
T-Rex: That's called EXTREMELY SEXY, my friend!
Utahraptor: BONUS CONTENT!
Utahraptor: REMEMBER: how awesome is that? How is that? We're all super sexy today!

T-Rex: Yes! Yes, I will do things that are less sexy than they were in the past.
Utahraptor: AW MAN! LOOK, I'M GETTING SEVERAL OF MYELF STDs.
T-Rex: DAAAAAAANG
