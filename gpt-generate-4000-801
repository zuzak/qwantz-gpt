T-Rex: I have taken the aesthetics and beliefs of the romanticism movement and adopted them for my own!

T-Rex: I now emphasize my own subjective experience as visionary and transcendental!

T-Rex: I no longer value piety or virtue, or constancy (or consistency), or even the search for scientific truth!  I only value my own capacity for experience!
T-Rex: As a consequence, my own actions can no longer be judged by any public idea of right or wrong!  As experience is amoral, even my own conscience cannot judge my actions, and I am free from reproach and judgment!

Utahraptor: But T-Rex, this is nothing more than deifying the ego, defiant of conventional morality!

Utahraptor: You've chosen for yourself a philosophy that justifies everything you do as good, simply because you did it!  Now tell me, how is that a useful moral and ethical system?
T-Rex: Well, um,
Utahraptor: "Well, um" exactly!

T-Rex: I thought maybe we'd have a good time discussing it?
