T-Rex: Oh crap! Everybody died!
T-Rex: I die every day I'm alive!

T-Rex: So it turns out that civilization itself has a part in death! Turns out the reason we're alive is that we've chilled out a lot and dropped our most basic building blocks off the cliff. If we've been dead for too long I'm not going to complain.

Utahraptor: But maybe you didn't die when you should've done!
T-Rex: That's what I'm going to say!

Utahraptor: But maybe you died just when you should've, because maybe you died reading a newspaper outside your window. Maybe that's where you came from! Your story's terrible but it's YOUR story! Your problem is you've never lived it. Your life is one of being taken advantage of, ashamed, and the ghost of a debt forgiven.

T-Rex: Done saying!
T-Rex: Hooray for debt forgiven!
