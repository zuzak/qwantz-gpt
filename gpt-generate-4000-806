T-Rex:  Hello and welcome to Spider-Fan, the #1 talk show for fans of Spider-Man.  As we all know, Spider-Man is a fake man who does not exist!  He only exists in the imagination of the average person who knows the works of Shakespeare, HILARIOUS UNIVERSE OMNIPOTENCE.

T-Rex:  Not only can we beat Prometheusism and even The Man Who Ignored the Fish Problem by HUNDREDS of years, we've beaten GOLDFIRTHONIZING OMNIPOTENCE by MILLIONS!  You've read our minds!  You've done our tests of Ignorance and've been Fated to.

Utahraptor:  You've beaten MURDERism and also MUTANTISM.  You've seen the FLAWS from YOUR COMPUTER'S TENT.  You've seen how your computer can do all sorts of things for a few dollars!
T-Rex:  All I'm saying is this!

Utahraptor:  So what's your problem?  Why are you complaining about everything not being perfect?
T-Rex:  Fed up with all these OTHER things you can't fix and also can't even see ever being perfect?  Have you ever tried naming a robot after your friend who totally understands?

T-Rex:  You can fix it by shifting blame for problems to the individual consumer, but that usually doesn't fix the problem.  You can turn it around and make it something more youal collaborative.  It's the sort of thing you don't think about when you're eating or having a fun meal.

T-Rex:  It's kinda neat and I regret to inform you it works like this:
