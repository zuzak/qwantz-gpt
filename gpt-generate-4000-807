T-Rex: Have you ever noticed that summer is when pretty girls come out?

T-Rex: I have not.  I've just been longing for...sexy sex with a sexy professor!

T-Rex: Not only have I been hoping this, but I've been wishing it for years!

T-Rex: I'm so in love with a sexy professor that I've decided to spend all my time avoiding sex.  I'm so into sexy things that I'll spend my time anyway.
T-Rex: *sigh*

Utahraptor: That's depressing, isn't it?  If there's a button to be had... it's not "no, I don't want to be a sex addict, but I still want to be a sex organ", it's when you're being assured of future success with a particularly sensual life.
T-Rex: ...True!

Utahraptor: That's what I'm saying!  If I had, I wouldn't have that much to say!
T-Rex: It's true!
Utahraptor: That's depressing, T-Rex!

Narrator: THAT EVENING...
T-Rex: Would the woman whom I have kissed recently mention having sex?
Utahraptor: Impossible!
T-Rex: Impossible!
