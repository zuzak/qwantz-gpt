T-Rex: One day a babysitter wondered why the kids were so quiet, so she went to the basement and there was a murderer with a bloody knife there, and that explained why the kids had been so quiet!!

T-Rex: Welcome to "A Spooky Tale, or, OMG TERROR" - by me, T-Rex!!

T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for going on hunger strike!
As the sun sets, it becomes clear that the kids will be fine! They eat only salad and nothing else. Then they go to bed.
As the house is now a zombie-infested forest, the clock is ticking...

Utahraptor: And the clock is ticking...forbidden forest?
T-Rex: The forbidden forest.

Utahraptor: The forbidden forest, I see.
T-Rex: I know. This scares me. I mean, I understand why the kids wanted to stay, all alone, but why they wouldn't have liked the whole place if they had been somewhere else. And also why there's nowhere else to go but out of town, so they wouldn't have gone to bed early.

Narrator: Later:
T-Rex: So... I rounded up the kids and ate all their food.
