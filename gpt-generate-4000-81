T-Rex: I have other interests beyond sex!  For example I am interested in...

T-Rex: ... the Capgras delusion!

T-Rex: The Capgras delusion occurs when someone believes that someone close to them - a dear friend, spouse, or family member - has been replaced by an identical-looking duplicate!  What seems to happen is that the automatic EMOTIONAL responses to seeing someone familiar one day stop happening, so when they meet their loved one, they have an intense feeling of something being OFF about them.  They don't feel like they normally do!

Utahraptor: And that means they believe they've been replaced by a duplicate?
T-Rex: Some of the time!

T-Rex: Not everyone leaps from that feeling to "they've been replaced", but some do, and that's the Capgras delusion!  There's variants where people feel that their pets have been replaced, or their shoes, or things like that.
Utahraptor: It's probably really terrifying and frustrating that nobody is willing to believe you.

God: T-REX WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO BECAUSE IT'S ALL ANALOGOUS
T-Rex: God! I Am SO PISSED OFF.
God: OH AND I'M THANKED THAT I REMIERATE YOU FOR CREATING UNIVERSES
God: THAT WAS MY ASSIGNMENT
