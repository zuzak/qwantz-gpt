T-Rex: I've entered a poetry contest!

T-Rex: I can't lose!

T-Rex: Right, Dromiceiomimus? I'm a brilliant, intrepid poet, and if I stay at home and write poems, I risk falling behind in my studies and AT THE END END WRITING: I have nothing to write about!
Dromiceiomimus: Well, I think your case is better than your never-before-seen chance.
T-Rex: Writing is hard, isn't it?  I've DONE it.

Utahraptor: So who wants to write?
T-Rex: I do!  I don't know who else wants to write.

T-Rex: I named myself "mouthman" and just want to share... poetry?
Utahraptor: That's a term you can't use on your application form.  I know!  Poems that begin "T-Rex" maybe?
T-Rex: We learn more about you after you sign up for my mailing list!

T-Rex: You can also name your children, but that costs money!  I cut that out.  You can name your career but instead focus on what you do and what you learn about others: I recommend you do something new and different every day.
T-Rex: Awesome!
T-Rex: Also great!
