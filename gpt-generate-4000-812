T-Rex: I have come up with the best way to sound sage and wise! And it's so easy, too! All you have to do is respond to statements with one simple phrase:

T-Rex: "Oh, you'll grow out of that!"

T-Rex: Try it out, Dromiceiomimus! Tell me something.
Dromiceiomimus: Um, I - I really enjoy bicycling?
T-Rex: Oh, you'll grow out of that.

Utahraptor: I've never bikened before, T-Rex, but I presume you're familiar with the principles of drag coefficient and blah blah blah.
T-Rex: Okay, I'll try it out, Utahraptor!

Utahraptor: Okay, you're already out there doing stuff. This sounds like a challenge for you!
T-Rex: I believe it is.  Alright, I'll try it out, Utahraptor!!
Utahraptor: I believe it is.  Oh, I believe we'll meet at the lake.

Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I believe we'll team up at the lake.
Utahraptor: You're already there, T-Rex! This sounds much more awesome than actual lake.
T-Rex: I'M GOING HOME.
T-Rex: AND I WILL, ONCE AGAIN,
