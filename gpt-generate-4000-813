T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! Oh MAN.  I'll never work that out.

T-Rex: Frig, right?

T-Rex: The book is about a guy who puts all his learning into a single book, and when I'm done with it all (I've got) I'll write a what's-a-a-a good-life story about how I became a scavenger, and I'll return the book to the same plastic bottle I just left in the bowl of my dressing room.
T-Rex: ...Now!
T-Rex: That's a deal!

Utahraptor: And what if I make a new book deal?
T-Rex: You're screwed!

T-Rex: The teacher showed up and said "For years we spent alone in groups of four or five people, doing things we never could have done if we'd all been equally social creatures", and I said "What?  Because you've done that, and it's not like there's anything else I've ever done!"
Utahraptor: Hah hah!  I think I get stuck in!

Narrator: THAT EVENING...
T-Rex: Wow, this teacher's a useless piece of cake!
