T-Rex: I don't like it when something bad happens. Well, IN PARTICULAR, I don't like it when something bad sucks and I get emotional. Well, in partied out emotional sluts...

T-Rex: ...THAT is what they are, duh.

T-Rex: Not anymore! I'm not interested in such painful and stinging losses! I'm instead looking for the ultimate happy little end to be held in this uncertain time...
T-Rex: ...and lost in the rue of defeat!

Utahraptor: You're - you're not disappointed!
T-Rex: What? I'm disappointed! What is?

Utahraptor: You've got to admit you disappointed are some of the most upsetable people you'll ever be friends with.
T-Rex: It's true! I'm sure we'd talk about that in a day or two, once I got out of bed.

Narrator: THAT EVENING...
T-Rex: HAH HAH HAH!
