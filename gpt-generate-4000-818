T-Rex: Okay, so maybe "hugga bubba" ISN'T the best adjective.

T-Rex: Maybe it is though!!

T-Rex: But just in case it isn't, I've invented an entirely new way for it to be used! JUST LIKE THAT, ONLY BETTER. Instead of saying "Yo, I'm Superman and I want to hug" it says "Let's hug!"
Dromiceiomimus: I always hugga bubba / Let's hug on account of how great I am.
T-Rex: I say "let's hug" but it says "be sure to put your hugga bubba down" and we hugfied!

Utahraptor: What if I hugga bubba this guy?
T-Rex: For EXACT PROFIT!!

T-Rex: Maybe we hugga bubba your friend, OK? Or maybe our eyes meet and fall in love and we share a bed and dromiceiomimus and we become good friends. Let's do it!!
Utahraptor: That sounds awesome! Let's do it!!
T-Rex: I know it!!

Narrator: BUT SOON:
T-Rex: You know what I lose when I lose my hugga bubba?
T-Rex: And I lose all the fun times I describe in my autobiography?
