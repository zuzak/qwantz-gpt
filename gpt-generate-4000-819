T-Rex: Oh crap I forgot to include... cars with broken chapeaus on them!
God: WHAT

T-Rex: WHAT

T-Rex: MY COLOURS SURROUND THE SYMPATHY OF VANILLA FIRE
THEORY

T-Rex: A car dealership hands over a cheque, right? To charity! But does it ever happen to charity? There's a gun to save the artist: a gun that shoots down any offer of donated time and time again! The artist only wants the cash, and not be a burden on the lender: the gun saves the lender from a bad debt, and also if the artist goes into a bank and gets the money, the gun saves the artist from a bad debt too!

Utahraptor: So you want the gun, but you want it in a good faith effort to save?
T-Rex: Well if it's a GOOD faith effort then I GET IT.

T-Rex: But if it's a HOLD ON TO GIANT LINES and you want the artist to be happy, sure, but I don't believe you can deny that the vast majority of his output is art!
Utahraptor: And he's not holding back from art.
T-Rex: He's still holding out hope of being Jay Park, but it's much more accessible than I was led to believe.

T-Rex: He's happy that his life has not been reduced to garbage, but instead become more of a chance for community, a way of life that I believe has sadly failed.
Utahraptor: Aww! That's cute!
