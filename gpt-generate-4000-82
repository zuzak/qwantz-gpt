T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for pointing out the failures of others!

T-Rex: I will consider it as an act of HARM TO OWN UP!

Dromiceiomimus: No- one can say this, T-Rex. Why can't we just admit that we DO, in fact, do things differently?
T-Rex: I am willing to say it.  I am willing to say it.

T-Rex: I'm not intimidated.  I'm serious!  I'm serious.  I was looking for some free time.  I made it.
Utahraptor: You're really looking for free time?

T-Rex: I am!  It's an amazing utopia, with all the utopias and dictators and all the freetimbered corpses of other utopias!  All I need is a phone line and some sweet rocks.
T-Rex: There are no presidents or jailers on hold!!

T-Rex: There is, in fact, a phone line and a jail!
Utahraptor: Well, you're either that, me, or a phone line and a jail!

T-Rex: No man!  You're both stuck in this one situation, and you're probably better off just getting served some slow-motion slow-mo.
T-Rex: Th- That, Utahraptor, would an be served a serving of slow-motion slow-mo.
T-Rex: Utahraptor!!
T-Rex: That is the number one rule of serving a phone line, dating all the way back to the name of Utahraptor all the way back to the frying pan!!
