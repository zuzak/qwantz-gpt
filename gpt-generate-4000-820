T-Rex: I have cooked up the best pizza ever. It is my pi?ce de r?sistance!
God: WITH YOUR TERRIBLE FRENCH ACCENT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING "MY PIZZA RESISTANCE"

T-Rex: Oh my GOSH I need to open a pizza place called "Pizza Resistance"!

T-Rex: Resistance! Dromiceiomimus! You're not supposed to mention it! You're the personification of resistance! You're the worst name ever.
Dromiceiomimus: And you're by default based in Brussels.
T-Rex: THAT'S GREAT DUDES!! HOW CAN THAT be OK??

Utahraptor: With your pizza resistance? Brussels?
T-Rex: FINE. But notice how everything is better in "Pizza Resistance" but everything is worse in "Pizza Flights For The Resistance"!

Utahraptor: I named the place after the first house I built, which was all, "Oh, it's just a WWII film set and a pizza dude! What's it like?"
T-Rex: Well, it's cool if you say it like "And everyone on my street has a nice hip future!"
Utahraptor: ...
T-Rex: Dude, that's kinda great.

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX IS A PROFESSIONAL SINGLE SPEED RUNNER:
T-Rex: With my spinning "speed" (whatever that means!)
God: OH MAN I'M GONNA FIND OUT OKAY
T-Rex: But you can watch the TV Speed Trial!
God: I'M GOING ON A PRIORITY
