T-Rex: I have been thinking about what I like best about being a chef: are the foods I eat worth the effort?

T-Rex: I think it's a social good!

T-Rex: And I like it when I say this thanks to you, the person eating the food.  I get to feel like a rude, overconfident old man - like a sweaty, clammy version of Metaporn, wearing a clam booty barely below a bun.  I'm the kind of guy who, for a change, might look like this:

Utahraptor: And you're also the guy who shouts "I'M SORRY I WAS TERRIFIED!!"
T-Rex: I know!

Utahraptor: I think that actually says a lot about how poorly you know someone.  You have to be APPARENTLY level though, because someone so poorly knows something is bad.  And the only way to know what's bad is to not know at all!
T-Rex: Dude, I could tell a lie every time I wanted to do that.

Narrator: UTAHRAPTOR ONCE AGAIN RESOLVES YOU TO KEEP EATING THESE FLAVOUR AND PHENONE BABIES
Narrator: THE END
