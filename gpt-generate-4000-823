T-Rex: ALL ABOARD THE MAKEOUT EXPRESS! YOUR TICKET IS MAKEOUTS. PLEASE HAVE YOUR TICKETS READY.

T-Rex: AND YES, I WILL BE CHECKING IN IN MIDDAY: the next day!

T-Rex: AND MAYBE THIS CONTAINS HOURS of wasted time! Attention, attention, laziness!
Dromiceiomimus: all you busy-assholes, you have my full support!
T-Rex: Oh, future generations will have no idea who was busy at the makeout dinner you're making.

Utahraptor: Wow! I wonder if it's 'tis 'tis 'tis 'tis' time you stopped talking about makeouts!
T-Rex: What? I punched him!

Utahraptor: Man, I fair no his advances! I punched him as well!
T-Rex: Heh! Consider that your epitaph is basically a call to action for the underprivileged!
Utahraptor: Um - yes! Also, I don't think it's as punchable as it is.

T-Rex: And yet, I resolve to punch your mustachio-twirling feet later!
T-Rex: I will punch you in the bum as you walk out the door!
T-Rex: Oh no, now I have a good epitaph!
