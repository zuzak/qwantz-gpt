T-Rex: Let's say you can live in any time period in history. Which period do you choose?

T-Rex: I choose the future!

T-Rex: Or at least, I did choose the future until I realized that things might not ACTUALLY be better down the road. If I lived 300 years from now, I could be living in a post apocalyptic time where most life has been obliterated by a catastrophic asteroid impact - an impact so large that enough dirt has been thrown into the sky to BLOCK OUT THE SUN, disrupting the entire food chain and causing mass extin-
T-Rex: Anyway, that's a possibility or whatever!!

Utahraptor: So the past is the only safe choice.
T-Rex: Exactly!

T-Rex: But then I thought, well, there's a lot we don't know about the past either. And I wouldn't want to choose a time where it turns out nobody could make poop jokes or they'd go to jail and also nobody thought to write any of this down, so the whole deal is lost to history!
Utahraptor: So I'm stuck here!
T-Rex: No!

Narrator: YEARS LATER:
Utahraptor: Man, I go to a time-traveling spaceship that takes me back in time.
T-Rex: AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
