T-Rex: You know what I'm tired of feeling?
God: EMOTIONS
T-Rex: Pain!

T-Rex: (Emotions too.)

T-Rex: That's not really empathic or spiritual or whatever, but it's at least getting me out of bed and getting me out of here. Pain is an unnecessary, yet powerful drug!
Utahraptor: Pain relieves all desire!

T-Rex: What? I've been wanting it all day!
Utahraptor: My friend, I'm tired of it! I just can't handle it in moderation.
T-Rex: It's worth a try!

Narrator: AT THE PARK:
T-Rex: What's wrong with you, Mr. Tusksman, and if I have to return to my cabin I'd prefer it if my feet are smooth and polite instead of tense and menacing?
T-Rex: pain!
T-Rex: (also, I hate it when people quote Shakespeare and mean that depression is the "wonderland crash" of the 20th century)
