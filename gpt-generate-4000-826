T-Rex: I admit it: a few days ago, I was tripping substantial balls over the fact that light takes time to reach me from across the room. I sigh and try again:

T-Rex: HOLD ON A SECOND, DON'T TELL ME TALK ABOUT TIME.

T-Rex: Fran went from tripping to tears after a while, and yeah she was tripping, but it was at least partially over her. I don't know why, but she was tripping on pretty substantial balls right now!
Utahraptor: Oh, I see.
T-Rex: Yeah, I see.

Utahraptor: And then Utahraptor was like, "Oh.  I didn't know light was speed so I was tripping across the room while still holding onto light," and I was like, "Oh.  I don't understand."
T-Rex: The fact that you are talking about light speed has an impact, Fran!

Utahraptor: Yeah, it's a subtle but pervasive effect!  It can make a room seem like an awkward place, a waste of space, and, I don't know... MORE awkward?
T-Rex: RIGHT.  It can also make a room seem awesome.
T-Rex: "OH GOSH, HOW GREAT IS HEATER"
