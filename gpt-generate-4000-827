T-Rex: I have made a very important New Year's Resolution! It's to make sure that my name becomes an EPONYMOUS ADJECTIVE.  People will soon all describe things as "T-Rexian"! What sort of things?

T-Rex: Awesome things, natch!

T-Rex: Wait, huh? I'm not the sort of person who says "natch". I never say "natch", I say "naturally" and even then only sometimes.  I have no idea why I said "natch" just now.  I'd like to take it back, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: Hah, hah, too late! Looks like being T-Rexian is using unpopular and out of favour slang for no reason!

T-Rex: Aw, shoot! My eponym is a disaster!
Utahraptor: Plus it wouldn't even get used that often!

Utahraptor: The only time I can imagine using it is - well, when describing you.
T-Rex: Wait! PEOPLE will soon be saying "screamin' T-Rexian" and "screamin' evil T-Rexian"!
Utahraptor: I can see the appeal in that!

T-Rex: Hey, for a change!
T-Rex: I can also see the use of "T-Rexian" in the corporate media, since that's become just such anachronistic!
T-Rex: I'm at the point now where I find myself agreeing with each of their words and ideas, and my words and ideas are being reduced to gibbering, no-nonsense T-Rexian.
