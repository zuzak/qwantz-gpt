T-Rex: If you think you're about to die, you see your life flash before your eyes. But there's a catch. You have to live every day just to make that happen!
T-Rex: There's a way!

T-Rex: a way no-one else could ever achieve!

T-Rex: Our current world is a utopia, for heaven only! Dromiceiomimus, what if you were just a spectator sport?
Dromiceiomimus: That would be farcical, T-Rex, for heaven only! The world would be filled with people just like you.
T-Rex: Sure! I guess that would be pretty... pretty much all I had to do!

Utahraptor: Wait, heaven's all for you!
T-Rex: I guess I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between Utahraptor and T-Rex at all!

Utahraptor: I'm glad you're not obsessed with being a "travelling, shambling ghost"! You know, you get along really well and if you're lucky, you'll eventually run into God.
T-Rex: Huh?
Utahraptor: Yeah, I'm a good friend. I do everything well, but I'd be a disaster on a course for a funeral.

T-Rex: I'll do better, Utahraptor! I'm going to do everything, "travelling" - what, 100% destroyed Everest?
Utahraptor: I'm not going, as I know you're all preparing for this exact situation.
T-Rex: I'm not!
Utahraptor: Yeah, it's not unlike living a classical moral and philosophical life!
T-Rex: Ew!
T-Rex: Sometimes, that is!
