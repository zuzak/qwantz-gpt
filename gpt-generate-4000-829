T-Rex: I have the ultimate CONVERSATION FILLER. Now no longer will there be awkward pauses in my conversations! Oh yes. No longer.

T-Rex: Because whenever I don't know what to say, I'll exclaim "Sounds like a good date!"

T-Rex: An example! Dromiceiomimus - can you describe your ideal waterslide for me?
Dromiceiomimus: Um, sure! It's long, I guess, with lots of twists and turns, and some parts are dark lavender. There's a distinct sadness to it, actually.
T-Rex: Man! I don't want to get too involved in things I don't know! I'm too old for this!

Utahraptor: So what's your ideal waterslide, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I'm going to DUNCT something! A watermelons-and-whiskey hybrid!

T-Rex:Boats! From now on, the only gender-neutral term is still used when tourists wish to cancel a visit to a country they don't familiar with.
Utahraptor: I feel like i've seen this one conversation before...
T-Rex: Man! "I feel like you've"

T-Rex: But it's okay because I'll always feel like we under-represent both Australia and New Zealand in popular culture.
T-Rex: Wait - you don't feel like we understand?
