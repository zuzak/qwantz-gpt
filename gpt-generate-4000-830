T-Rex: If you ever find yourself in a situation where people will give you money if you don't pay what you owe the government, then you've found the software for that to be way overdue!

T-Rex: I'm talking "let's replace that with a real one, with insurance policies that say "covered" and what not to buy.  I've got ABSOLUTELY NOTICED TIMES.

T-Rex: Pfft.  You know what I'm talking about.  The guy paid the loan I got from the government and they covered the cost of the INSANE INSANDNESS OF my idea.  When I was a kid I always wondered if there was anything I could do more than buy more time, and then I realized buying kids time was such a sucky move!  I could be doing just about anything, and the government was just getting around the rules on a large and personal level.

Utahraptor: Man, I think you could do both!
T-Rex: I do!

Utahraptor: I think you could soak the whole thing in one swoop, then come up with an insurance policy that says "DANG IT, YOU'RE SO SURE YOU'RE UNLOCKING IT ON TIME" and then you can be all, "I'M SO SURE I'm paying soon!"
T-Rex: Yeah but I can't do that.  I can't TRY it.
Utahraptor: YAWN

Narrator: YEARS LATER, UTAHRAPTOR ONCE AGAIN:
T-Rex: yesssss
T-Rex: my dad got the better part of the problem and I gotta say
