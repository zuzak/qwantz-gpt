T-Rex: I finally figured out how to gain the upper hand on that stupid utahraptor. I will adopt for my own the philosophy of pragmatism.

T-Rex: From now on, I'll be sticking to things that WORK!

T-Rex: For instance, some might say that the destruction of this log cabin violates fundamental principles. However, if I were to show that it is a necessary means to a noble end, such arguments are revealed to be petty and ideological!
T-Rex: Pragmatism!
Dromiceiomimus: But you didn't... oh well, too late.

T-Rex: Similarly -
Utahraptor: T-Rex, you have to stop using such tin.

Utahraptor: You sure know how to use something narrow, T-Rex.
Utahraptor: Only meaty stuff.
Utahraptor: Hah! I think I get it. I get it.

T-Rex: All I really want is a philosophy that means something, that means something. That philosophy was too valuable, and I really don't see any other philosophy that has meant anything.
T-Rex: I'm gonna say... T-Rexism?
