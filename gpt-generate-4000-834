T-Rex: I have finished a new novel! This is my best novel yet, for the simple reason that it includes one critical aspect:

T-Rex: A sex scene!

Dromiceiomimus: You wrote a sex scene?
T-Rex: Yep! It's HOT, if I do say so myself!
Dromiceiomimus: But what if someone you know reads it? What if your MOM reads it?
T-Rex: Shit! I hadn't thought of that!

T-Rex: Damn damn damn! What am I going to do? I'm doomed!
Utahraptor: You're going to jail!

T-Rex: Damn damn damn damn!
Utahraptor: Well then! I guess I'm doomed as a free man, huh?
T-Rex: That's what I thought!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, would you like to hear my story, okay? It's less depressing than the other two songs.
Dromiceiomimus: Awww!
T-Rex: It's not boring! It's awesome!
