Narrator: HOW TO USE WIKIPEDIA
T-Rex: Wikipedia is amazing if you want to know facts about something, but INSTEAD decide to ask me embarrassing, yet non-trivial, information.

T-Rex: Do you know how to delete a site? I've confirmed by finding out how to make it difficult or impossible to edit it?

T-Rex: I have the skills!
Dromiceiomimus: Wait - I've never been at a place where I can say "forget about facts" and get a life of expertise in a subject?
T-Rex: Man!
T-Rex: Game over!

Utahraptor: Wait, this has been a while since your last post!
T-Rex: Oh, sorry!

Utahraptor: Sorry! The knowledge you brought to this conversation is nothing more than a stupid theory developed by people who have never actually been to a planet where Wikipedia is actually used for useful facts!
T-Rex: Aha! But you realize that you need to delete stuff that's not useful, so you need to travel to Saturn and say "We estimate that dust is contained within 0.006 G skeins of standard deviation."

Utahraptor: ...I actually meant only thatipedia requires actual ground but you can get it at the grocery store.
T-Rex: Saturn doesn't have ANY standard ground is all!
Utahraptor: Oh, no bigs, I'm sorry, I think Wikipedia just fell over?
T-Rex: I-
T-Rex: I'm sorry
