T-Rex: Is it that we don't have enough willpower?

Narrator: MORE RESOLUTION

T-Rex: I have a solution!
Dromiceiomimus: A solution to the "You can't go" dilemma!
T-Rex: Yes! Exactly!

T-Rex: If you're a human, you can't walk into a store and find something that's made of meat. Can you then freely choose how your digestive system works, and if so, where that stuff gets its food from?
Dromiceiomimus: I think I can, by virtue of voluntarily eating some random food.

Utahraptor: That's a pretty difficult dilemma to answer!
T-Rex: It's true! It's like trying to solve the English dilemma!

Utahraptor: You're right: it's really hard to solve.
T-Rex: Yes! It is TOO difficult to answer!
Utahraptor: Thanks, but I'm off!

T-Rex: I have the solution, Utahraptor! I'll walk in and say "Hey, you're gross and I want food, let's try something new."
Utahraptor: Then, from 1:59 PM EST come in and eat some fast food!
T-Rex: I've GOT THE ANSWER!
Utahraptor: Now we're homered!
