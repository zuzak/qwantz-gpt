T-Rex: Okay, so maybe "hugga bubba" ISN'T the best adjective.

T-Rex: Maybe it is though!!

T-Rex: But just in case it isn't, I've invented a new way for it to be used! JUST LIKE THAT, ONLY BETTER. Instead of saying "Hugs! You are the worst dater!" Say "Hugga bubba, huddle down next to the wheel."
Dromiceiomimus: What's that?
T-Rex: Instead of "Hugs!" We say "Churn eyes on chairs?"
T-Rex: "Hugga bubba, huddle next to the wheel next to the burnt rubber ball with the red glow from an alive rubber ball"

Utahraptor: What if it's the whole world, instead of the webbing?
T-Rex: Oh man!

T-Rex: I don't don't know. It's just - I used the webbing analogy too, but it sounds more like "Hugga bubba, huddle next to the wheel" than "Hugga bubba, huddle next to the wheel"!
Utahraptor: Oh my goodness!

T-Rex: What's that? "Hugga bubba, huddle next to the wheel"?
Utahraptor: IT'S THE RETURN OF THE WEBPABLE?
T-Rex: WHAT?
Utahraptor: THE RETURN OF THE WEBPABLE?
T-Rex: OH MY GOD!
T-Rex: MY GOD
