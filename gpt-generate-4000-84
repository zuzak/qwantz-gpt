T-Rex: I have a great idea for a story!  I'll give people something to read while they are at it!  Then, they will stop they and say "Huh.  I'm bored.  What is my idea?"

T-Rex: Suddenly, all was lost in an endless stream of "III THE TRUTH", which also led to another endless stream of "III THE BAD DOWNSAPPEDOW!!!"

T-Rex: So, ladies and gentlemen: stop reading now!  This story gets better all the time.  I'm going to tell people the TRUTH.  It's important.
T-Rex: It's "The Ultimate Sad Story."

Utahraptor: I'm not sure what you're getting here, T-Rex, but we've been working on it for years!
T-Rex: I'm not sure what!

Utahraptor: I don't think it's going to be for very long.  We're only getting a few artists funded, so a whole project is way more entertaining than just a single medium.
T-Rex: But we, as a people, develop a distrust of money in the arts, and a distrust of sequels, so it's not that bad.  But we need to start questioning how the medium existed, and how it's being used in the past.

Narrator: T-REX SOLVES THIS PANEL: "THE DOWNSAPPEDOW.  OUR ONLY INVISIBLE TRUE ENDING."
T-Rex: ...Huh.
T-Rex: Good God
T-Rex: I'm not allowed to use money in the way you're supposed to!!
