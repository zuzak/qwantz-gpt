T-Rex: Man, how great would it be to have a TATTOO? Assuming it does not go disastrously wrong, it certainly does not have to go well!

Narrator: T-REX'S BIG TATTOO

Dromiceiomimus: How would you sum up a tattoo? A complicated system of care, a communication system that allows one to communicate with both the hands and the tattoo patient, a whole body!
T-Rex: A thing that I call "a multi-generational problem".

Utahraptor: And? What about "a boring aging process that slowly dies"?
T-Rex: A thing that would end when that process is complete!

Utahraptor: Oh! That's a good one. Get to work!
T-Rex: Got my own!
Utahraptor: What? No!
T-Rex: Got nothing to do with tattoos!

T-Rex: Huh! That actually makes sense, because I know of zero people who've done it and had no history of breakups.
