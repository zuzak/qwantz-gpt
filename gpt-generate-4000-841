T-Rex: What day of the week is it?  IT'S NOT IMPORTANT, because all that matters is that today it's time for another...

T-Rex: SECRET of the art of writing!

T-Rex: Once you know the rules, then you can write them backwards for me.  For example, it's totally acceptable to write "today" in 1792 as "today" and "today".  That's the game!
Dromiceiomimus: But what about "1800?"
T-Rex: That's the version of the rules that we actually have!  Can millenia hold together?

Utahraptor: Yeah, I just think we're stuck with the 1820s?
T-Rex: I think so!  Can you make the rules more complicated?

Utahraptor: Yeah, I guess!  Maybe if they're all equally valid, we'll all come back to you and say "Ah, but such a system would have been better if the winner had been a different person."
T-Rex: "What?  Someone else else else's system had been better?  Someone else else else else else else else else else else else else else else else else else"
Utahraptor: "Better yet, no matter what you do, T-Rex, you will find I've found another way to win!"

T-Rex: Wait nevermind!  I WILL DIE ALONE!
T-Rex: Because, like everyone else, I've decided to wake up in a freshly died-out bod!
