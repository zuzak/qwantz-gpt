T-Rex: God, come over me whenever you want to eat pie!
God: OKAY
God: LET'S DO THIS
God: UM
God: ACTUALLY

T-Rex: Okay, here's what I want for Christmas Eve: all I ever wanted is for everyone in the world to come over and eat some pie, and I just told you I was going to make you some new Christmas Eve lace, and I would be leaving some fabric at the front of the pie, and I would be pressing the fabric up against your fleshy backside. I would be writing down your name on the fabric, and I'd attach my name on the fabric too.

Utahraptor: So where do I go to get the fabric?
T-Rex: The front!

Utahraptor: I believe this is where you'll get the new fabric.
T-Rex: FINE. There's enough fabric there. Rubbermaids has enough fabric there. They're marking your fabric for you, and they want your name on the fabric.
Utahraptor: I believe this is where you'll get the new magic!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I just hope nobody terrible gets murdered!
T-Rex: RESOLUTION: FOOD IS INCREDIBLY EXTRAVAGENT
