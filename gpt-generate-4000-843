T-Rex: You know what they say: you can't take it with you!  You can't keep it with friends!  And yet -

T-Rex: -dromiceiomimus!  You can't truly love someone, despite their orifices being pretty good!  You can't PRACTICE sex, and yet, you find intercourse to be the best part of the party!
Dromiceiomimus: What if I said I love you?  You would not appreciate it.
T-Rex: *gasp*

Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: T-Rex, you came today just to see me celebrate your friend's 20th birthday!
T-Rex: awesome!  And come back when you want to hear my stories!

Utahraptor: Well, you came today to see me discuss your friend's 20th birthday!  We'll be discussing your idea about personal relationships being turned into "social capital" and how it exploits our irrational fears of senior citizens for a sweet "cool factor" that bears demographic trends!
T-Rex:o

T-Rex: Well, I guess we'll be... one big conversation, huh?
