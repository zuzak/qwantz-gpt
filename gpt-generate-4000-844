T-Rex: It's Christmas Eve!  Why do I feel like the only way I can express my true feelings is by sailing away into space!
T-Rex: AND THERE'S A MALL FOR YOU

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Whoooo!
T-Rex: I feel so close to ending up being a... (sigh) ... mom!

Utahraptor: Is this just a regular holiday?  Not even the name implies that mom and dad are topless.
T-Rex: Really?  I think it really is that famous a holiday.

T-Rex: "The image of the weeping mom hugs you as you approach tears fills you with the sincere sadness of a single woman."  So famous!  EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THE TIME TO WRITE IT.
Utahraptor: I'm not sure it is.  Seriously, me, not even trying to be lovey-dove bros.
T-Rex: Really??  I dunno.  My emotions are fine.  I'm probably SUPPOSED to feel happy.

Narrator: THIS COMIC BROUGHT TO YOU BY TOURISM EUROPE:
T-Rex: I'm afraid you don't have a firm grasp on Christmas!
T-Rex: Why, you just gotta face it, man!
