T-Rex: I have the greatest idea for a movie!  I've said this before but this time it's for serious.  There's this cop, right?

T-Rex: Right!

T-Rex: And he's a main character who has been doing all this stuff for generations!
T-Rex: I thought we'd all be hanging out with this cop, I guess?
T-Rex: Hey, it's not like I'm wasting a potential screenplay.  There's a main character!  A cop with a heart of gold!

Utahraptor: So what's the movie?
T-Rex: A remake of the ACTUAL MASONIC T-Rex movie!

T-Rex: I'll save the world by focusing on plot, right?  But the new film wants to downplay characters, try to make you care about moral grey areas, and rewrite your life for the pretty girl you're meant to marry!
Utahraptor: What are you trying to do wrong?
T-Rex: I'm just trying to make the characters seem moral!

T-Rex: The moral of the story is that when a man or a woman is supposed to lead a life of love and good will, then they do fall through time and time again!  That's not the point.  The point is that time is an illusion and we as a species have an obligation to remember that time is never absolute.

Utahraptor: Man, you've totally changed your life!  Why would you make a movie about it?
T-Rex: Man!  I've ALWAYS felt like I was the only person connected to the past 80 years after I started one myself!
T-Rex: And I'm not even talking about the problems and the possibilities that await me in that time!
