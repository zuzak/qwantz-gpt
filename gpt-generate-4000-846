T-Rex: Hey God, is there someone you'd best meet on a specific day?
God: Hah hah hah PHEW PHEW

T-Rex: That I fear! On the one hand, I find it irresistible!

God: ONCE AGAIN REVEALED INTERESTING IN COMPLETELY CHECKING DEATHPOTS AND SPOILS AND PLACES AND SOURCES AND EVERYONE QUITE AWESOME
T-Rex: On the other hand?
God: I HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS AND A HALF- YEARS AGO
T-Rex:...Okay, DAMN IT!

Utahraptor: But people always ask if there's someone you'd best meet on a particular day!
T-Rex: Sure!

T-Rex: AND I would love to meet you! On that particular day I would find someone awesome!
Utahraptor: That - that person would be awesome! On that particular day all the dudes would fall in love!
T-Rex: Heck, I would be awesome! On that particular day I would write a love poem for your very own excrement!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Today's diary: I would like to see more of your breakfast cereal.
T-Rex: Huh.
T-Rex: *I* would like to see more of your breakfast cereal.
