T-Rex: You know what's awesome? When there's a story on the news, and then they go to people "on the street" for their reactions to the story!

T-Rex: Wait, did I say "awesome"?! I meant "HOLY COW< SO TERRIBLE!"

T-Rex: They're stopping the flow of information to literally ask RANDOM STRANGERS what they think. The only way it'd be acceptable is if they prefaced these stupid segments with "and now, here's what some strange folks on their way to do something better had to say!" but THEY NEVER DO.

Utahraptor: It's not that bad, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's SO BAD.

T-Rex: It's not even scientific, because it's not close to a representative sample. it's just noise! From now on, whenever the news does this, I'm going to take it as saying "We don't care about facts, just about burning through your finite lifespan! Hey, here's some guy who'd talk to us."
Utahraptor: Okay

LATER, T-Rex shows up and he's like "Now this stranger we've never met agrees! We've all done it to each other and I'm not sure we've ever felt that way about ourselves."
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: ...I feel way better now, actually
