T-Rex: So - wait. What am I out for? I've got a new friend who I haven't seen in a while. Maybe they'll bring her back with them for a more "in" time.

Narrator: BACK AT HOME...

T-Rex: SOMEHOW I've stood by and wait for them to come!  SOMEHOW!

T-Rex: I don't understand.  I've never been so ignored!  Be the most important thing in my life!
Dromiceiomimus: That seems pretty unreasonable!
T-Rex: I know, right?  It's the reason I live here.
T-Rex: It's the reason I make so many of the songs I remember from my youth... BE ME!

Utahraptor: Man, there's the guy I used to babysit and who by the time you're 30 has babysatted at least TWO others!
T-Rex: For God's sake!  WHY DOES HE CONTINUE TO VISIT THIS HOUSE SO HARD?

Utahraptor: I don't know, I just wanted to see if this woman was still bothered by someone!  I don't think babysitting her would make a big deal of a short trip.
T-Rex: You babysat two other people's kids today?  PERHAPS??
Utahraptor: PAID for two hours of babysitting??
T-Rex: This bill you'd be well-rested and polite, Utahraptor!

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: OH, NONE OF THEM PAID for TWO HOUR!
T-Rex: THIS PLACE, HAVEN'G ME, IS THE WEAKEST WEAPON VIRUS IN THE UNIVERSE
