T-Rex: The number of atoms in my body is probably around 6 x 10^29.  That's a 6 followed by 29 where goat, robot, and house are all named after the same single core design.

T-Rex: Hooray for robot naming!

T-Rex: Anyway, the essential feature of naming is that you always end a name on a premise, even if that premise is incredibly unlikely!  I think that's called for!  If a show says I'm going to fight crime, I'll name that show "Knife to the Teeth"!  Or "Eggplant for the Bodies"  and then some!
Dromiceiomimus: "Agony and Inundation"??
T-Rex: Because poison and inversion are the two fundamental beliefs of any transcendental being!!

Utahraptor: So why is Odin's name so interesting?  It seems like he's a bad guy too!
T-Rex: Why not just give him a chance?

T-Rex: Well I've been doing an experiment in which the only logical way is for everything to turn into a story!  I'll start with fairy tales, then turn the characters around, and finally, let the reader decide if the story is really about Odin or about a woman who has revealed his real identity, disguised as a cat!

Utahraptor: Okay, so let's assume Odin's story is about a woman who has revealed his real identity, disguised as a cat.  Let's then assume Odin's fairy tale is about a man who does not believe in Christmas!
T-Rex: Hello?  And a secret identity, chosen by me to be the most accurate and accurate fairy tale character ever!

Narrator: LATER: EVERYONE GETS A TEEN version of THIS!!
