T-Rex:  Guess who had their first dream of flying last night?  The only way it was clear... was to climb up a mountain, and then land on a planet of disappointed skyscraper-sized corpses!

T-Rex:  But then y'all gonna eat us all, surely by then!

T-Rex:  This dream is cuter than the real one; why do we even have illusions of this beauty?  Why do we have illusions of progress?  Why do we have illusions that history is just a series of recallable, predetermined images?
T-Rex:  I bet it's entirely thanks to you and your ilk.

Utahraptor:  What if I told everyone that I was on a mission?
T-Rex:  Oh, just make it sound as if I'm on a mission!

T-Rex:  JUST LIKE IN NOHS.
Utahraptor:  Ah.  Well, I guess you too will try PUNCHING something, rather than fly around and farting.  Or, if it's an actual mission, MAKE EVERYTHING ABOUT TOYS T-REX.
T-Rex:  You're seriously planning this?
Utahraptor:  No.  You're going to fly around and farting and not try to eat anyita.

Narrator:  LATER:
T-Rex:  Everyone, come quick!  I-
T-Rex:  I want to see if you're ever hungry!
