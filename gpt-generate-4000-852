T-Rex: I have a great idea!  A way to get all my friends on the same page with this comic!

T-Rex: FOR EXAMPLE: let's say you're a friend of friends.  Then you come over for dinner and I ask you to pretend like you don't know your friend.  You're totally not my friend, right?  But... you're looking forward to your friend's company, so here's your excuse.
T-Rex: ...Wait, you're not my friend!  You're a stranger!

Utahraptor: So we get people dinner and you're coming over for dinner?
T-Rex: No!

Utahraptor: Well, you're coming over for dinner, and then you come over for dinner for me.  And then you whip up a whole new friendship!  You're my friend, right?
T-Rex: I -
Utahraptor: "You're a stranger, myself, who I find delightful."

T-Rex: "But remember when you were dating someone else?  WE'LL PARTY ON."
Utahraptor: "You were with someone else, yes?  WE'LL PARTY ON."
T-Rex: "That is someone else, and I - okay, wow, that's a lot of other people on the same page."
T-Rex: "I think everyone is inherently valuable, whatever that means."

T-Rex: "And yet, I do like someone who tells interesting stories and who truly believes in themselves and in their abilities as a person."
Utahraptor: "RAW ORANGE IS THE WORD"
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: Hah!  SANGING DOCTRINE!
