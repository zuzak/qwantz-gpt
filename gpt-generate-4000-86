T-Rex: I have been thinking of registering a domain name.  Is it even possible?

T-Rex: This is the thing I have been wanting to do!

T-Rex: I am so looking forward to this day!  I am going to get real busy!
T-Rex: I am so looking forward to Dromiceiomimus becoming my social network!

Utahraptor: domain names don't exist yet!
T-Rex: What?!

Utahraptor: domain names do not exist!
T-Rex: What?!?!
Utahraptor: domain names do not exist!  What the hell IS a " domain name" and what country IS it listed on?  My room!

T-Rex: Oh my God!  My room!!
T-Rex: My room!!
T-Rex: My t-rex is brimming with interest!  Why does Dromiceiomimus have to move into a room that doesn't exist anymore?
