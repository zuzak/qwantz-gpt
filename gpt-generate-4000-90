T-Rex: I have kissed a lady.  I have seen PLENTY of beautiful sunsets.  I've even driven a car through a fruit stand during a car chase!

T-Rex: ...What's left?

T-Rex: This, my friends, is the malaise of the glutton at life's buffet, The Man Who Achieved Too Much Too Soon.  He looks ahead, his life not half over, and sees no more frontiers to conquer, no more challenges, no more surprises!  All that remains is a slow slide into compromise and old age, the long December spent waiting for the day his mind and body finally fail.

Utahraptor: Then what happens?
T-Rex: Man, who's going to pull the strings?

Utahraptor: Nobody.  The man washes his dishes, and then he goes and does his best.  This is what you thought!  This is what YOU were thinking.  This is what YOU felt.  And now, you think you know how it happened.  I'm going to call the police!
T-Rex: Dude, there's no way your story is going to turn into this!  All I'm saying is that it's possible.  I'm going to call the cops and say, "I think you were in on this, and I think you were way too busy with work to remember about it!"

T-Rex: They'd say, "No arrest, just tell the guy you saw that."
T-Rex: Man!  I wish I called the cops!  You complete an idyllic existence nightmare.  You too could become a law unto themselves!
T-Rex: My existence is made possible by a few dollars!
