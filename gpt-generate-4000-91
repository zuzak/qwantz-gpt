T-Rex: Oh my goodness, is my absolute favourite weather TRULY the high winds just before a storm?
T-Rex: I have considered the matter and my answer is this:

T-Rex: Most assuredly!

T-Rex: The wind is awesome.  You can stand on the edge of a cliff, leaves swirling around you, staring out in the wind - into DESTINY - and it's just great.  Everything feels dramatic and apocalyptic and LIFE ITSELF.  I stand as an adult and behold the wonders of SUNSETS alone!

Utahraptor: So your favourite weather is: wind.
T-Rex: Yes!  Wow, that's neat!  I'd say it's actually a good storm.

T-Rex: You are about to recite one of my favorite parts of your mind'scap, "I'm now going to lie down and stare into the face of the GOD".
Utahraptor: Ah.  So powerful.  Anyway, what's next?  Or maybe you should I'mrigion??

Narrator: AT THIS EXACT MOMENT:
T-Rex: Excuse me, Mom, you forgot your keys!
Mom: T-Rex, I just forgot my keys!!
T-Rex: Oh no, my Mom's found them and she thinks I'm a big fraud
