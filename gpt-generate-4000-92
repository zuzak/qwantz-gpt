T-Rex: I have come up with an excellent way to be happy! Every time someone says a sentence, I simply add a few words onto it:

T-Rex: "In my opinion, I mean, and I say this without exaggeration: I would not wish to know the answer to THIS COMIC."

T-Rex: I say "In my opinion, I mean, and I say this without exaggeration: I would not wish to know the answer to THIS COMIC!  It is for this reason: Dromiceiomimus.
Dromiceiomimus: Thanks for the - how do you do it?
T-Rex: I use a clicker, see!

Utahraptor: You can also use a corpus organometahty, discovered after dosing with T cells from the human eye, or using conjugated cultures, which are identical in structure to those from the eye, but have much more structure found in the human eye.
T-Rex: What?
Utahraptor: Both!

T-Rex: Utahraptor, your technique still works if you're not careful. I only take my pay change.
Utahraptor: I take my pay change.
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: . . . WAIT.
