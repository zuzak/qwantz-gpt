T-Rex: I have the ultimate CONVERSATION FILLER. Now no longer will there be awkward pauses in my conversations! Oh yes. No longer.

T-Rex: Because whenever I don't know what to say, I'll just exclaim "Sounds like a good date!"

T-Rex: An example! Dromiceiomimus - can you describe your ideal waterslide for me?
Dromiceiomimus: Um, sure! It's long, I guess, with lots of twists and turns, and some parts are dark so it's scarier, and everyone's screaming! Oh, and at the end, we all accidentally get chlorinated water in our eyes.
T-Rex: SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD DATE, my friend!!

Utahraptor: What? It sounds like a good date, actually!
T-Rex: NUH. It's not bad, Utahraptor. It's good.

Utahraptor: Hey, I thought it was pretty cool, but I can't remember where you came up with it.
T-Rex: MAYBE, thanks!
Utahraptor: But wouldn't you be at least CRAZY if I did?

Narrator: THAT EVENING...
T-Rex: MOM you're awesome if you remembered that you can come up with clean water dates, right?
God: T-REX I'M GOD AND I REQUEST AN EXTRA FRIGGIN' YEAR
God: ONE FOR THE PAST AND NOTY THE WAY IT MONTHS TEACH
T-Rex: Sure! One for the past, and two for the future!
God: OKAY
God: I GOT A PLANET TREE
