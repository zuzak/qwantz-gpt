Narrator: COMICS IN WHICH MATTERS TAKE A SUDDEN TURN

Narrator: today's comic
Narrator: THE WORKSHEET

T-Rex: Ever find yourself in a situation where you're not the smartest guy in your class, or the best friend the rest of the class can be?
Dromiceiomimus: I mean, I guess that depends on the situation on which you're placing it.
T-Rex: The situation could be SO different from me, where as <x> there's no statute of limitations for sexual battery, where as <y> you may now be violating the LOOTING FACT that I'MARCID AND Would Like To Comply.

Utahraptor: Yeah, that depends on the situation on which you're placing it!
T-Rex: And depends on your grade point average, Utahraptor.

Utahraptor: Yeah, but I'd still like to know where you live, where you go, where you're going, and, if possible, where you're going because you're BASICALLY in the right place at the right time.
T-Rex: If you're not in the right places at the right times, I'm sorry, but please, continue your addictive behaviour by quitting today.

T-Rex: It's not hard, is it?
