T-Rex: Hey, who wants to party? I woke up and I said "I want to party!"

T-Rex: So I stuffed the hatchet back into the fridge!

T-Rex: Now all the watermelons are in and I'm ready to go!
Dromiceiomimus: You ready to go too, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I'm already in the mood!

Utahraptor: Whoo! You ready to go Dromiceiomimus?
T-Rex: I am!

T-Rex: I love Dromiceiomimus! I love her spirit. And don't worry Dromiceiomimus, I'll just get Utahraptor and have her take the credit!
Utahraptor: Huh. I guess!

T-Rex: I haven't seen her since high school, so I guess I DIDN'T see her until now!
T-Rex: But I've just got to meet her at a party, and she'll be pleased!
