T-Rex: Let's say all vegetables are suddenly super nutritious, so it doesn't matter which one you eat!

T-Rex: The catch is you can only eat one vegetable for the rest of your life!

T-Rex: So what you do is you take a sample of food and add it to a mixing bowl. If vegetables taste gross, wash it with hand, and if it's gross you eat well. If vegetables taste good, eat them smart!
Dromiceiomimus: Sounds great, T-Rex!
T-Rex: EXACTLY!

Utahraptor: But there's no way I'm eating any!
T-Rex: No way!

Utahraptor: Sure there is, and I'm guessing intelligent design won't be around to see how it works.
T-Rex: Good god! That sounds like a super cute vegetable. I wish I was smarter!!
Utahraptor: No, I meant, you know, just have more research into it and you sort of extrapolate that on itself.

LATER, T-REX INITTS HIS CANDIDATE OF UNDERSTANDING:
T-Rex: Hey, I have another cake!!  This one's called "VEGETABLES" and I have made it delicious!
T-Rex: Also, I've invented a confusing new slang that seems to have been invented by accident, you know?
T-Rex: Also, I invented a new slang that seems to have been invented by accident, you know?
