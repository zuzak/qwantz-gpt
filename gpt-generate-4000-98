Narrator: DINOSAUR COMICS
T-Rex: Dinosaurs were giant ferocious lizards!

T-Rex: These were the apex predators of the day.  They hunted, chip, and baked like they were some kind of big-game animal.
T-Rex: They were big on security, sherpas, firemen, and even a small vigilante called "sorcerer".

Utahraptor: So you thought they were seaborne?
T-Rex: I thought they were awesome!

T-Rex: But then I found out their teeth were different!  They were different Dinosaur teeth.  And they shared a common ancestor with the creature the most.  The end.
Utahraptor: How do you know?  My dictionary is more important
T-Rex: The dictionary?

Utahraptor: I thought they shared common features with the platyrones, which is why I defined their origin story!
T-Rex: Well, I guess we're closer to the dinosaur than the platyrones are.
Utahraptor: I guess... we're a little closer to the platyrones?
T-Rex: Little closer to the DEEN!!

Narrator: LATER, BACK AT SEA LEVEL:
T-Rex: The thing with lizards is they're so cute!
Utahraptor: The thing with lizards?
T-Rex: The REAL question is, is this a good metaphor?
