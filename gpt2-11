Narrator: Utahraptor and T-Rex are talking about spiders.

T-Rex: The other day I was out in the yard when I heard this strange hissing sound coming from outside.
T-Rex: I went outside to see what was up and there were these little spiders all over the place.

Dromiceiomimus: So the other day when you heard this your first reaction was, I wonder what's the deal with these spiders?
T-Rex: Well there isn't a deal with them, it's just a little weird.

Utahraptor: I'm guessing they're mating? The males of this species are always looking for females.
T-Rex: Well yeah they are they do.

Utahraptor: So they can see eachother's scent?
T-Rex: They can. I saw one the other day, the big one was sitting there and the little ones just kept looking at eachother and then the big one came and stood close by.

T-Rex: It was a little creepy.
