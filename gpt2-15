T-Rex: Someone at my house finished off a bag of milk, and then put it back in the fridge without replacing it with a new bag!
T-Rex: That's so annoying!

T-Rex: I'm not sure why he did that.

Dromiceiomimus: Yeah, we don't do that, because we're not milkmen!
Dromiceiomimus: If it was us though, we would replace it all.

Utahraptor: I hate it when people don't put new bags in their fridge. It's like a waste.
Utahraptor: Well that's just your opinion, and if you find it annoying, I'm sure you can find more reasons.

Utahraptor: But just as a matter of fact, milk was once a very rare commodity. So you can't just get rid of it!
T-Rex: I didn't hear about that! Oh, and a bag is like a pound, and it's not milk, it's like...

T-Rex: Just a bag?
