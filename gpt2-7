Narrator: T-Rex, Dromiceiomimus, and Utahraptor are talking.
T-Rex: I have the best joke for Dromiceiomimus!

T-Rex: If I can only get to the top of a pile of books...
T-Rex: Then I can tell the best joke for Utahraptor!

Dromiceiomimus: If you can only get to the top of a pile of books, why don't you go to the top of a pile of pancakes instead?
T-Rex: Because pancakes taste better!

Narrator: Utahraptor is surprised and starts laughing.

T-Rex: Because pancakes taste better!

T-Rex: Because they have more sugar!
