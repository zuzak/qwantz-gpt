Narrator: T-Rex, Dromiceiomimus, and Utahraptor are talking.
T-Rex: I have the best joke for Dromiceiomimus!

T-Rex: He's not a dinosaur, he's a reptile.
T-Rex: The world may end tomorrow, I am a dinosaur.

Dromiceiomimus: Yes you are.
Dromiceiomimus: And I am a T-Rex.
T-Rex: So... you know?
T-Rex: We're not the same thing!

T-Rex: We're not real!

Utahraptor: What are we?

T-Rex: You are a T-Rex!
T-Rex: This is a fake-out!
