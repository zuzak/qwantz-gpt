T-Rex, Dromiceiomimus, and Utahraptor are talking.
T-Rex: I'm not a dude who usually has dreams, but last night I dreamed I had a whole other house, had forgotten about paying the mortgage, and was now horribly in debt?

T-Rex: It sounded pretty realistic.

Dromiceiomimus: That's pretty much the dream that any sane person can have, right?
Dromiceiomimus: Yeah. It's not a dream I've seen in a hundred years, but I guess it's a pretty common dream for a guy.
Dromiceiomimus: So what happened?
Dromiceiomimus: Why are you here?

Utahraptor: I woke up at like 5:00 in the morning. Went downstairs to get something. Told myself I was going to work in the morning, but I didn't wake up. I don't remember anything, but I'm sure I did something. I'm sitting here at 3:30 AM and I can't remember what I'm doing?

T-Rex: This isn't a dream, right?

T-rex: No. This is a dream.
